,× Expand Photo by Caitlin Abrams picnic essentials Gear Up: The best picnic is a spontaneous picnic  so keep essentials at the ready in the back of your rig.
,We paired our large tote with the perfect picnic blanket  which has just the right amount of thickness  a smooth surface (won’t attract grass and twigs)  and fabric that won’t easily snag.
,Banh mi sandwiches are one of life’s picnic triumphs: French-Vietnamese hybrids in which an airy baguette is stuffed with aioli and a harmony of herbs  quick-pickled vegetables  and fillings such as tofu or grilled chicken.
,Tell the kids you’re going to have a fancy picnic like ones you see in magazines.
,When you pull up in front of Yum!  pop your trunk and a nice person will put your picnic in your car.
,Choose a picnic site with a grill  light a match—yep  you’re officially a picnic rock star.
,Picnic is the first full-length collaboration between Kansas City’s Ryan Loecker (aka mdo  co-founder of the C Minus label) and Melbourne  Australia’s Justin Cantrell (aka ju ca  founder of the Daisart label).
,But the communal spirit of Secret Musik lives on in Picnic  which doubles as an international ambient summit welcoming Australia’s Daisart into the fold.
,Heavy on guest features and bundled with more than 80 minutes of remixes  both on the digital album and the limited-edition Bonus CD  Picnic is a celebration of ambient music as a social phenomenon.
,The vinyl version of Picnic runs eight tracks and 41 minutes  including a remix of C Minus co-founder Pil’s “Plush Hooves.”
,But Picnic delights in the way these materials interact.
,There’s an appealing sense of grit throughout Picnic  suggesting sediment flowing downstream or embers leaping from a bonfire.
,Picnic offers few moments of uninterrupted ambient pleasure.
,The bulk of Picnic’s real estate is taken up by percussion  which means both actual percussion instruments and the digital clicks and cuts that saturate nearly every inch of the record.
,Picnic deserves credit for managing such a rough and organic sound without being too hard on the ears  but it’s tough to just sink back into this stuff and relax  and ambient fans who like their music a little more amniotic might find the terrain too rugged for their liking.
