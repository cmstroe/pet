,× Expand Photo by Caitlin Abrams picnic essentials Gear Up: The best picnic is a spontaneous picnic  so keep essentials at the ready in the back of your rig.
,We paired our large tote with the perfect picnic blanket  which has just the right amount of thickness  a smooth surface (won’t attract grass and twigs)  and fabric that won’t easily snag.
,Banh mi sandwiches are one of life’s picnic triumphs: French-Vietnamese hybrids in which an airy baguette is stuffed with aioli and a harmony of herbs  quick-pickled vegetables  and fillings such as tofu or grilled chicken.
,Tell the kids you’re going to have a fancy picnic like ones you see in magazines.
,When you pull up in front of Yum!  pop your trunk and a nice person will put your picnic in your car.
,Choose a picnic site with a grill  light a match—yep  you’re officially a picnic rock star.
,Picnic is the first full-length collaboration between Kansas City’s Ryan Loecker (aka mdo  co-founder of the C Minus label) and Melbourne  Australia’s Justin Cantrell (aka ju ca  founder of the Daisart label).
,But the communal spirit of Secret Musik lives on in Picnic  which doubles as an international ambient summit welcoming Australia’s Daisart into the fold.
,Heavy on guest features and bundled with more than 80 minutes of remixes  both on the digital album and the limited-edition Bonus CD  Picnic is a celebration of ambient music as a social phenomenon.
,The vinyl version of Picnic runs eight tracks and 41 minutes  including a remix of C Minus co-founder Pil’s “Plush Hooves.”
,But Picnic delights in the way these materials interact.
,There’s an appealing sense of grit throughout Picnic  suggesting sediment flowing downstream or embers leaping from a bonfire.
,Picnic offers few moments of uninterrupted ambient pleasure.
,The bulk of Picnic’s real estate is taken up by percussion  which means both actual percussion instruments and the digital clicks and cuts that saturate nearly every inch of the record.
,Picnic deserves credit for managing such a rough and organic sound without being too hard on the ears  but it’s tough to just sink back into this stuff and relax  and ambient fans who like their music a little more amniotic might find the terrain too rugged for their liking.

,A fast charging station of Dutch charging company Fastned is pictured during its opening in Limburg  Germany  June 22  2018.
,Dutch charging infrastructure company Fastned (FASTN.AS) has teamed up with Tesla (TSLA.O) to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Oxford  England  it said on Friday  sending its shares higher.
,The hub of 38 charging stations  will include 26 ultra-rapid chargers from Fastned and Tesla  with additional AC chargers from Spain's Wenea  and is scheduled to open at the end of 2021.
,The intial 10 Fastned charging stations will be able to charge EVs simultaneously at rates allowing drivers to add up to 300 miles (482.8 km) of range in 20 minutes  the company said.
,Fastned shares rose almost 8% to 55.6 euros at 0837 GMT.
,"should indeed help (Fastned) further increase its public profile in the UK and may allow it to replicate the same development strategy in other municipalities across Europe "" Berenberg's research analyst Jan Richard said."
,The hub will be Europe's most powerful electric vehicle charging hub with up to 10 megawatts of power available for future expansion  Fastned said.
,Fastned  based in Amsterdam  has built 137 fast charging stations across the Belgium  Britain  Germany  Switzerland and the Netherlands and aims to expand into France.
,And this is exactly what Amsterdam-based Fastned provides – a fast-charging network for electric vehicles.
,In a recent development  Fastned announced that it has teamed up with Oxford City Council  Pivot Power  Tesla  and Wenea to build and operate one of its largest fast-charging stations at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford (ESO).

,The Fastned station will have up to 14 fast chargers and there will be 12 Tesla Superchargers on site.
,It all started with Ola’s acquisition of the Amsterdam-based EV startup Etergo BV  which had to undergo a fire sale or face bankruptcy.
,Lauded as the ‘Tesla of e-scooters’ by the European and Dutch media  Etergo was a crowdfunded initiative that raised millions of euros in two crowdfunding rounds.
,But after raising around €21 Mn ($24.8 Mn) in equity financing from more than 6 000 individual investors (most of them were carried away by the e-scooter craze)  the company got sold to Ola Electric for €3.75 Mn ($4.44 Mn) valuation  according to internal emails and multiple Etergo investors who spoke to Inc42.
,More than 900 investors who put their money into Etergo through crowdfunding campaigns are now in the process of filing a lawsuit in a European court to recover their money from Etergo and its current owner Ola Electric.
,Many of them have held onto their shares since 2017  hoping to get their hands on the swanky App Scooters promised by Etergo.
,Founded in 2014 by Bart Jacobsz Rosier and Marijn Flipse  Etergo had conceptualised an all-electric state-of-the-art AppScooter that depends on battery-swapping for a quick recharge and an increased run time.
,But according to two investors aware of Etergo’s operations in the Netherlands  even after three years of research and development since 2015  not a single scooter was delivered to people who purchased actual shares in the company via a pseudo-public offering.
,Etergo BV diluted around 10% equity stake in September 2017 and set up a STAK with targeted funding of €1.5 Mn ($1.7Mn)  which was also its first publicly raised money.
,Etergo used Seedrs  a platform that allows European retail investors to buy shares in private companies.
,The Seedrs page for Etergo is still live and indicates that the scooter was supposed to go into production by Q2 2018.
,“Although the first public funding (crowdfunding) happened via Seedrs  the owners of the company later used their own website to gather and raise funds  as they started getting momentum for their brand… Everything was fine until late 2019  and I got some email from the (investor relations) team promising that the scooter would be delivered by March 2020  and then suddenly it was sold to an Indian company by May 2020  and none of us got any such heads  and I learnt from the news itself ” says an Amsterdam-based investor who picked up shares worth €5 000 in Etergo in 2017.
,A copy of the prospectus issued by the company and reviewed by Inc42 reveals that Etergo was valued at north of €65 Mn in March 2019.
,But after the buyout  the per-share price came down to €0.0179986  according to emails sent to Etergo investors in May 2020.
,The email also mentioned that they might redeem their shares at €0.0179986 per unit  which according to Inc42’s estimates  values Etergo at around €3.75 Mn after the Ola buyout.
,According to the email exchanges between Etergo and two different shareholders  which have been reviewed by Inc42  the Dutch startup has also stated that investors do not have an option to hold onto their shares or convert those into equity shareholding in Ola Electric.
,Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans  according to the most comprehensive study to date.
