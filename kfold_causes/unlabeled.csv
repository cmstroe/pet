,× Expand Photo by Caitlin Abrams picnic essentials Gear Up: The best picnic is a spontaneous picnic  so keep essentials at the ready in the back of your rig.
,We paired our large tote with the perfect picnic blanket  which has just the right amount of thickness  a smooth surface (won’t attract grass and twigs)  and fabric that won’t easily snag.
,Banh mi sandwiches are one of life’s picnic triumphs: French-Vietnamese hybrids in which an airy baguette is stuffed with aioli and a harmony of herbs  quick-pickled vegetables  and fillings such as tofu or grilled chicken.
,Tell the kids you’re going to have a fancy picnic like ones you see in magazines.
,When you pull up in front of Yum!  pop your trunk and a nice person will put your picnic in your car.
,Choose a picnic site with a grill  light a match—yep  you’re officially a picnic rock star.
,Picnic is the first full-length collaboration between Kansas City’s Ryan Loecker (aka mdo  co-founder of the C Minus label) and Melbourne  Australia’s Justin Cantrell (aka ju ca  founder of the Daisart label).
,But the communal spirit of Secret Musik lives on in Picnic  which doubles as an international ambient summit welcoming Australia’s Daisart into the fold.
,Heavy on guest features and bundled with more than 80 minutes of remixes  both on the digital album and the limited-edition Bonus CD  Picnic is a celebration of ambient music as a social phenomenon.
,The vinyl version of Picnic runs eight tracks and 41 minutes  including a remix of C Minus co-founder Pil’s “Plush Hooves.”
,But Picnic delights in the way these materials interact.
,There’s an appealing sense of grit throughout Picnic  suggesting sediment flowing downstream or embers leaping from a bonfire.
,Picnic offers few moments of uninterrupted ambient pleasure.
,The bulk of Picnic’s real estate is taken up by percussion  which means both actual percussion instruments and the digital clicks and cuts that saturate nearly every inch of the record.
,Picnic deserves credit for managing such a rough and organic sound without being too hard on the ears  but it’s tough to just sink back into this stuff and relax  and ambient fans who like their music a little more amniotic might find the terrain too rugged for their liking.

,A fast charging station of Dutch charging company Fastned is pictured during its opening in Limburg  Germany  June 22  2018.
,Dutch charging infrastructure company Fastned (FASTN.AS) has teamed up with Tesla (TSLA.O) to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Oxford  England  it said on Friday  sending its shares higher.
,The hub of 38 charging stations  will include 26 ultra-rapid chargers from Fastned and Tesla  with additional AC chargers from Spain's Wenea  and is scheduled to open at the end of 2021.
,The intial 10 Fastned charging stations will be able to charge EVs simultaneously at rates allowing drivers to add up to 300 miles (482.8 km) of range in 20 minutes  the company said.
,Fastned shares rose almost 8% to 55.6 euros at 0837 GMT.
,"should indeed help (Fastned) further increase its public profile in the UK and may allow it to replicate the same development strategy in other municipalities across Europe "" Berenberg's research analyst Jan Richard said."
,The hub will be Europe's most powerful electric vehicle charging hub with up to 10 megawatts of power available for future expansion  Fastned said.
,Fastned  based in Amsterdam  has built 137 fast charging stations across the Belgium  Britain  Germany  Switzerland and the Netherlands and aims to expand into France.
,And this is exactly what Amsterdam-based Fastned provides – a fast-charging network for electric vehicles.
,In a recent development  Fastned announced that it has teamed up with Oxford City Council  Pivot Power  Tesla  and Wenea to build and operate one of its largest fast-charging stations at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford (ESO).
,A large  fast-charging station - with Fastned and Tesla chargers - will be built at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford on Oxford’s ring road in the UK  as the fruit of a partnership between Pivot Power  Oxford City Council & Wenea.
,up to 14 Fastned chargers (10 initially)  rated at up to 300 kW
,The site will get up to a 10 MW power supply from renewable sources (part of that will be Fastned's solar canopy) and an energy storage system.
,"""Fastned  the European fast charging company  teams up with Oxford City Council  Pivot Power and Wenea to build and operate one of it’s largest fast charging stations at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford."
,The Fastned station will have up to 14 fast chargers and there will be 12 Tesla Superchargers on site.
,It all started with Ola’s acquisition of the Amsterdam-based EV startup Etergo BV  which had to undergo a fire sale or face bankruptcy.
,Lauded as the ‘Tesla of e-scooters’ by the European and Dutch media  Etergo was a crowdfunded initiative that raised millions of euros in two crowdfunding rounds.
,But after raising around €21 Mn ($24.8 Mn) in equity financing from more than 6 000 individual investors (most of them were carried away by the e-scooter craze)  the company got sold to Ola Electric for €3.75 Mn ($4.44 Mn) valuation  according to internal emails and multiple Etergo investors who spoke to Inc42.
,More than 900 investors who put their money into Etergo through crowdfunding campaigns are now in the process of filing a lawsuit in a European court to recover their money from Etergo and its current owner Ola Electric.
,Many of them have held onto their shares since 2017  hoping to get their hands on the swanky App Scooters promised by Etergo.
,Founded in 2014 by Bart Jacobsz Rosier and Marijn Flipse  Etergo had conceptualised an all-electric state-of-the-art AppScooter that depends on battery-swapping for a quick recharge and an increased run time.
,But according to two investors aware of Etergo’s operations in the Netherlands  even after three years of research and development since 2015  not a single scooter was delivered to people who purchased actual shares in the company via a pseudo-public offering.
,Etergo BV diluted around 10% equity stake in September 2017 and set up a STAK with targeted funding of €1.5 Mn ($1.7Mn)  which was also its first publicly raised money.
,Etergo used Seedrs  a platform that allows European retail investors to buy shares in private companies.
,The Seedrs page for Etergo is still live and indicates that the scooter was supposed to go into production by Q2 2018.
,“Although the first public funding (crowdfunding) happened via Seedrs  the owners of the company later used their own website to gather and raise funds  as they started getting momentum for their brand… Everything was fine until late 2019  and I got some email from the (investor relations) team promising that the scooter would be delivered by March 2020  and then suddenly it was sold to an Indian company by May 2020  and none of us got any such heads  and I learnt from the news itself ” says an Amsterdam-based investor who picked up shares worth €5 000 in Etergo in 2017.
,A copy of the prospectus issued by the company and reviewed by Inc42 reveals that Etergo was valued at north of €65 Mn in March 2019.
,But after the buyout  the per-share price came down to €0.0179986  according to emails sent to Etergo investors in May 2020.
,The email also mentioned that they might redeem their shares at €0.0179986 per unit  which according to Inc42’s estimates  values Etergo at around €3.75 Mn after the Ola buyout.
,According to the email exchanges between Etergo and two different shareholders  which have been reviewed by Inc42  the Dutch startup has also stated that investors do not have an option to hold onto their shares or convert those into equity shareholding in Ola Electric.
,Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans  according to the most comprehensive study to date.

,The Dutch-French e-scooter company Dott may not be as ubiquitous as the likes of Bolt and TIER  both of whom have hit the 100-city mark  however it is expanding with deliberate care  with an eye on long-term investments in cities.
,"Maxim Romain  the co-founder and COO of Dott  spoke to Tech.eu’s Crossing Borders series about their international growth  why they prefer tenders  and opens up about their ""most costly"" business mistake."
,Having one of Dott’s two headquarters in Amsterdam “is not ideal” Romain says  as the company is not operating in the Dutch capital (their other HQ is in Paris).
,Dott  which has around 300 staff  has raised around €120 million  significantly less than competitors TIER and Voi  who have each pulled in around three times that.
,Dott co-founder and CEO Henri Moissinac said in an interview earlier this year that this “is not a game where you need to be everywhere.
,The only city they have exited so far is Munich  as consumer interest in scooters was not significant enough - not exclusively a Dott problem  Romain says competitors faced similar difficulties in the Bavarian capital.
,Dott keeps all their operations in-house  and doesn't use gig workers  for example  as juicers  which Romain says gives them an advantage with city authorities.
,The competitive landscape is a key consideration when identifying new cities to launch in for Dott — they are not in Berlin for example  as they consider it to be quite a saturated market.
,Dott prefers cities that organise tenders  as winning one helps ensure that their investment will be a long-term one.
,"As for the sustainability aspect  he says that they have done a lot of studies and found ""to our disappointment"" that users are not as focused on sustainability as Dott had hoped or expected  although the younger generation is progressively paying more attention to it."
,"Romain says Dott's ""most costly mistake"" was with an early fleet of scooters."
,The Dott co-founder has a pre-expansion tip for new startup founders: define your company culture from the very start.
,to discuss values and culture on day one at the company but that’s what we did at Dott  our first brainstorm was about this  and there's nothing I'm more proud of in relation to Dott than the quality of the culture and the team.”
,In fact  the research  commissioned by micro-mobility company Dott  found that we’re so bad at local discovery that almost half (45%) of Brits surveyed don’t know the names of streets near their home and a quarter admitted to not being able to direct a stranger to a destination in the town where they live.
,Duncan Robertson  Dott UK General Manager  said: “We’re excited to be launching our e-scooter hire service in the UK  and to be trialling this in London  to allow people to explore the city in a fun  economical  sustainable but - most importantly - safe new way.

,Bidroom is a travel booking platform aimed at bringing fairness back to the booking industry by providing low-priced hotel rooms to travelers and helping hotels save money in commission fees.
,Travelers can try Bidroom for free to see the value of its innovative platform.
,Thanks to Bidroom  travelers who are scouring the web for places to stay — and  hopefully cashing in some credit card rewards to boot — can access some of the lowest prices available for hotel rooms around the world.
,Bidroom was founded in 2016 by CEO Michael Ros.
,The basic premise is that travelers can become a member of Bidroom and gain access to great deals on hotel rooms.
,That means that  when travelers pay to become a Bidroom member — which is only $29 per year — they ultimately save a lot of money by taking advantage of the discounted rates accessible only through the innovative platform.
,The overarching idea behind the Bidroom model is to bring fairness to the travel industry.
,“We are a bridge connecting the hotels to their guests directly  giving control back to the hotels and the best prices possible to our members ” according to the Bidroom website.
,Hotel bookings are the main focus for Bidroom but members also gain access to a bevy of what Ros calls travel extras  made possible through partnerships with various companies in the travel industry.
,These are all included as part of a Bidroom annual membership.
,“We don’t earn anything on this  like for example with Avis  people get a 15% discount just by having a Bidroom membership ” Ros said.
,These travel extras also include hotel perks such as late checkout  early check-in  wifi upgrades  and other benefits  according to the Bidroom website.
,Bidroom announced in 2019 that its members can now use Apple Pay for added convenience and security.
,Travelers who have booked through another service (for rooms without cancellation penalties) can send Bidroom their booking confirmation.
,Bidroom will then prepare an offer at a lower rate for the same room.

,Amsterdam  May 10th  2021 - Online manufacturing platform 3D Hubs today announced it has rebranded to Hubs.
,Hubs  formerly 3D Hubs  is an online manufacturing platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of manufacturing partners.

,VanMoof first came on my radar when Apple announced the first few products that were compatible with the Find My network.
,The VanMoof S3 and X3 joined the likes of Belkin’s SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot item finder as the first third-party with built-in Find My integration.
,And while I was initially most excited to learn how Find My would work with a bike  the VanMoof S3  with its sleek black exterior  simple lines  and uber-clean weld seams  had me wanting one to call my own.
,Watch my hands-on video as I take the VanMoof S3 for a ride around the block  and be sure to subscribe to 9to5mac on YouTube for more.
,Video: VanMoof S3 – it’s like if Apple made an e-bike
,The first thing that stood out to me upon receipt of the VanMoof S3 is how the bike is packaged.
,Simply put  the design of the VanMoof S3 is the best that I’ve ever seen in a bike  electric or otherwise.
,The VanMoof S3  on the other hand  takes the exact opposite approach.
,After setting up the bike  you’ll need to download the VanMoof app from the App Store and set up your account.
,Settings is where I found myself most of the time while using the VanMoof app.
,Being one of only three third-party products initially compatible with Apple’s Find My network  this was the feature that initially put the VanMoof S3 on my radar.
,Locking the VanMoof S3 literally takes just a few seconds  thanks to the built-in kick lock on the rear wheel.
,But in Apple-like fashion  I found the VanMoof S3 easy to learn.
,The VanMoof S3 does this in a very natural way  with the front-mounted hub motor assisting with just a faint whirring sound.
,As you pedal  the VanMoof S3’s motor provides assistance  which can help you to easily power up a steep hill or quickly speed off on a straightaway.

,At the same time  co-founder of Hiber Laurens Groenendijk is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives ” the company said in a statement.
,Coen Janssen  chief strategy officer and co-founder of Hiber  commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector.

,Google is far from the first to do this  as apps like Aysa  Miiskin and SkinVision have been around for a few years.
,They are also invited to use the SkinVision app  which helps to identify common types of skin cancer by assessing skin spots and moles.
,Examples include Miiskin  SkinVision  and MoleScope  which has a skin-magnifying attachment for your phone.
,"Amsterdam-based skin cancer screening app SkinVision has raised $7.6 million in new funding from existing investors Leo Pharma and PHS Fund  with additional contributions from undisclosed new backers described by the company as ""high net worth impact investors."""
,SkinVision's app is currently available in the UK  Australia  New Zealand  and much of Europe.
,While SkinVision is working towards primarily offering the service via insurance providers  they also offer a direct-to-consumer option that has helped them to train their algorithms.
,de Heus is confident that the company's algorithm is reliable  although like most companies in the space SkinVision is careful to market itself as a non-diagnostic offering that complements a dermatologist.
,SkinVision will also use the funding to move toward an FDA submission in preparation for a US launch.
,The study focused on nine studies of different downloadable algorithm-based smartphone apps  including the widely available SkinVision.
,The authors highlight the “concern (...) about the impact of false reassurances” as the apps themselves market this trust  with SkinVision claiming to offer “a complete skin cancer detection service (...) to make sure you stay safe”  whilst lacking the adequate performance to back it up.
,However  in the study  they mistakenly refer to an app called skinScan from TeleSkin  based on a study from 2014  which they now understand was in fact looking at an earlier version of SkinVision.
,For instance  in 2019  SkinVision was integrated into the NHS.
,In a statement  SkinVision said: “We believe that for the benefit of public health  all algorithm-based smartphone apps should be researched and would like to continue leading by example  as we continue supporting clinical research of our algorithm.
,Digital health startup SkinVision is using smartphone tech and vision algorithms to allow consumers to track changes to their moles.

,Add photos  text  and points of interest and Polarsteps will do the rest.
,This is exactly what Polarsteps makes possible.
,If you are starting with Polarsteps  please add your Polarsteps trip before starting your trip via the Travel tab.
,Once you hit the road  Polarsteps will start tracking your ride.
,Polarsteps then asks you to fill in a so-called “step” every time you open the app.
,If you travel regularly and use Polarsteps  you can see exactly which routes you’ve traveled and where you come from most often.
,You can do this by viewing all the steps of your journey  but you can also create a picture book from Polarsteps.
,Polarsteps picture book is the only revenue model for the app developed in the Netherlands – the app is free and the developers do not intend to fill the app with ads.
,Polarsteps can be downloaded for free from the file Google Play Store On Apple App Store.
,What do you think of the concept of Polarsteps?
,Polarsteps just raised a seed round to continue developing its automated travel blogging app  to make the jealousy-machine run just that tiny bit smoother.
,Polarsteps is optimized for travel  which means that you don’t need data roaming or cell coverage to let the app do its thing: GPS works independently of mobile reception and the app synchronizes its data whenever you hit a pocket of cell reception — or when you log in to the Wi-Fi at the hotel at the end of a long  dusty day of travel.
,He clarifies that the Beta label reflects that the app currently has a limited feature-set and that it signals that Polarsteps is under active development.
,The implementation of Polarsteps is very well done  but the idea itself is not particularly original: there have been a slew of companies and solutions in this space over the years.
,Zivver  an Amsterdam-based challenger business in secure communications  has raised $17 million in new funding  bringing its total funding to date to over $30 million.
,Thanks to the new funding  Zivver plans to add in other features like digital signatures  secure forms and secure video.
,“With 40 percent of Dutch hospitals and local government and the entire Dutch Judicial System as customers  Zivver’s technology is proven to safeguard people’s personal data  which is essential as data protection regulations continue to evolve ” says Rick Goud  the startup’s CIO and co-founder.
,Zivver was named in Gartner’s 2020 Market Guide for Email Security as a Representative Vendor for Email Data Protection Specialists; awarded a place on the UK government’s G-Cloud 12 Framework for its cloud software services; and won a contract withinn the NHSX Clinical Communication Tools Procurement Framework  in partnership with Barrier Networks.
,Rick Goud is the CIO of secure digital communication enabler  Zivver.
,Before co-founding Zivver  Rick spent six years as a healthcare consultant for Gupta Strategists.
,He realised there was a strong need for a secure communication solution to safeguard and manage such data (including for DPA and GDPR compliance) – and shortly afterwards  Zivver was born.
,LONDON and AMSTERDAM – 12 November 2020 – Zivver  a challenger business in secure communications  today announced the availability of Zivver for Gmail  bringing the potential of enhanced email security and user experience to the millions of organisations worldwide using Google Workspace (formerly G Suite).
,The Zivver for Gmail extension gives organisations an effective way to prevent data leaks while not having to change their way of working.
,With Zivver for Gmail  organisations can share sensitive information via email with complete peace of mind.
,"This applies to both the information in the email and files in the attachments "" said Rick Goud  CIO & co-founder of Zivver."
,Zivver  identified as one of the five representative vendors in the 'Email Data Protection Specialists' category in Gartner's '2020 Market Guide for Email Security'  has always integrated seamlessly with the world’s most popular work email client  Microsoft Outlook (Desktop and Microsoft 365).
,Zivver comfortably fits in with existing ways of working.
,Users can easily add Zivver to their Gmail workflow and send communications as they normally would.
,Pioneering healthcare organisation Buurtzorg  active in 25 countries  participated in Zivver’s Gmail beta testing.

,Below we look at the patent filing strategy used by one of the winning companies awarded funding by NHSX  Aidence  based in the Netherlands.
,Aidence  who have developed AI-driven solutions for the oncology pathway  particularly for lung cancer screening  filed a patent application initially in the Netherlands in 2017  for a method which they have developed using a deep neural network to process 3D image data.
,Based on the initial local application  Aidence used the priority system to file an International (PCT) application  and extend their pending patent protection to Europe  Canada  China  Japan  and the USA.
,This strategy also has the advantage that the initial application provides an early indication on patentability from the national office at which the application is filed – in the case of Aidence's application  the Netherlands Patent Office.
,Here Aidence benefitted from a very positive initial search report from the Netherlands patent office  which can be of real value to early-stage companies seeking investment to demonstrate to investors that the company is likely to secure protection for their technology.
,"Once the PCT application is converted into the ""national phase"" applications in the countries of interest (in Aidence's case  Europe  Canada  China  Japan  and the USA) the applications may proceed at different rates and not all patent offices will take the same view of the application."
,Aidence's application is still currently pending at the European Patent Office (EPO).
,This strategy places Aidence in a strong position to secure valuable protection for its technology  but this is just one example of a possible patent filing strategy to support the successful scaling and commercialisation of a new AI-driven HealthTech technology.
,Some of the prominent players operating in the AI in medical diagnostics market are Microsoft Corporation (US)  NVIDIA (US)  IBM (US)  Intel (US)  Siemens Healthineers (Germany)  GE Healthcare (US)  Digital Diagnostics (US)  Xilinx (US)  InformAI (US)  Enlitic (US)  Day Zero Diagnostics (US)  Aidence (Netherlands)  Butterfly Network  Inc.
,Dutch-based medical AI company Aidence has won an AI in Health and Care Award to support the NHS plans to reduce lung cancer mortality.
,Aidence merited the award by showing that their AI-enabled image analysis application  Veye  can improve early lung cancer detection  and validate and accelerate the use of AI in healthcare.
,Aidence’s submission proved that its AI solutions can increase the speed and accuracy of early lung cancer detection.
,Aidence’s first application  Veye Chest  is analyses chest CT scans and is integrated into several NHS hospitals to detect  classify  and track the growth of potential lung cancers.
,At Aidence  we know AI has tremendous value in clinical practice  and we believe AI-enabled oncology pathways can transform cancer care.”

,Otrium has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its $26 million Series B round.
,The concept behind Otrium is quite simple.
,When items reach the end-of-season status  brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them.
,Otrium is currently available in Europe.
,With Otrium  brands can add another sales channel for those specific items.
,And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items  Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies.
,The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.
,Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time.
,With today’s funding round  Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses  such as Karl Lagerfeld  Joseph  Anine Bing  Belstaff  Reiss and ASICS.
,Dutch end-of-season fashion online marketplace Otrium has bagged US$120 million in its Series C financing round  which will go towards its upcoming U.S. launch and improving its technology platform.
,Otrium  the Amsterdam-headquartered online fashion “outlet” selling unsold end-of-season items  has raised US$120 million in a Series C round co-led by tech venture capital BOND and London-San Francisco investment firm Index Ventures.
,Otrium added that the Series C funds will support hiring and the growth of its team.
,Founded by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra in 2015  Otrium  which currently operates in Europe  enables clothing brand partners to sell their off-season inventory in order to avoid unsold fashion items from ending up in the landfills – or in many cases  especially for luxury labels  destroyed or burned in the name of brand exclusivity.
,Milan Daniels  Co-Founder & CEO  Otrium
,Particularly amid the pandemic  Otrium says that its digital business model  which embeds both convenience and sustainability  has flourished  with its revenues having tripled over 2020 despite the broader economic downturn for high street and brick-and-mortar players.

,By issuing guidelines calling for European regulators not to ban companies in the sharing space  startups like Peerby (a Dutch peer-to-peer lending platform for household goods) can count on fewer roadblocks as they forecast future growth.
,“In the end  the sharing economy will bring more benefits to [everyone] ” says Peerby founder Daan Weddepohl  who is scheduled to speak at this week’s Wharton Global Forum in Amsterdam.
,Peerby  the Dutch startup that allows people to search for things they need  like a hedge trimmer or a disco ball  has 250 000 users within communities in the Netherlands  major European cities and in the U.S.  Weddepohl says  adding that there is close to $1 billion worth of products available on the platform.
,Peerby is a “business model that takes underutilized assets and puts them to use ” Weddepohl says.
,He got the idea for Peerby when a fire in his apartment destroyed all his belongings and home in 2009.
,He turned the idea into the sharing service Peerby  which just won Weddepohl that oversized cheque at the AppMyCity competiton for best urban app  held as part of the New Cities Summit in Dallas  Texas.
,The app is simple: Peerby users can send out a request for an item they want to borrow.
,He opens Peerby on his iPhone to show me a map of his neighbourhood in Amsterdam: a sea of Peerby logos  with dozens of users on every street.
,One of the runners up to Peerby was Djump  a “social ridesharing” service that acts something like a hitch-hiking app.
,But unlike Airbnb or Uber  which take explicit aim at breaking into specific industries  Djump and Peerby are non-monetised apps that simply make it easier for city people to do what small-town folk have always done: hitch a ride  borrow some sugar.
,Dutch startup and TechStars London first cohort member Peerby is hoping to unlock the use value of that stuff with a collaborative consumption model that features some crucial differences when compared to others who’ve tried to turn caring into sharing for neighbourhoods.
,On Peerby  which has already launched successfully and grown at a fairly rapid clip at home in the Netherlands  users post requests for items that they need from their surrounding community  rather than just offering up a list of available “inventory” based on what they owned and are willing to share  the way it works on other networks that have attempted similar things in the past like Neighborgoods and StreetLend.
,“We’re launched basically in the whole of Holland ” Peerby co-founder and CTO Eelke Boezeman told me in an interview.
,Peerby’s request-based system for local borrowing and lending has earned it fairly high success and engagement rates – the startup claims that over 80 percent of its requests are fulfilled by Peerby members within 30 minutes of their posting.
,They maintain that this is because on Peerby  you aren’t dependent on having to find what you’re looking for before you request it.

,Both ChargePoint and EVBox have more established and diversified networks.
,EVBox has sold more than 235 000 charge ports  the most of any company.
,The business combination bringing EVBox public is expected to close in June 2021.
,Based on the valuation initially presented when the merger was announced  EVBox would have a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion at the current share price.
,That makes EVBox clearly cheaper on a price-to-sales basis  as ChargePoint's market cap is approximately $6.5 billion.
,The most concerning news is that the TPGY/EVBox SPAC deal may fall apart.
,Potentially the biggest SPAC news today is that the TPG Pace Beneficial (TPGY) / EVBox merger may be falling apart.
,It plunged -12.5% following an 8-K that called doubt as to whether their deal with EVBox will ultimately be completed.
,Adding more fast charging stations on the nation’s roads would bring down these barriers and accelerate EV adoption in the United States  according to a report from market research firm Ipsos and EVBox Group  a global provider of EV charging stations.

"Both of them are industry veterans as Lamers joined BUX from ABN Amro, where he was the Managing Director, while Stewart was previously Catawiki’s Vice President of People."
The duo joined BUX months after the fintech raised $80 million and is aiming to expand further into Europe.
"“It is BUX’s mission to shape the future of how Europeans invest…This requires a team of industry experts and innovative thinkers who can build on the strong foundation of what we started in 2014,” said BUX CEO, Yorick Naeff."
"“With these industry veterans onboard, and their wealth of experience and knowledge, we are bringing BUX to the next level to further shape the future of investing.”"
"“I’m thrilled to be entering the dynamic fintech space, and I am passionate about BUX’s mission to help empower a new generation of investors to take ownership of their financial future,” Lamers said."
"On the other hand, Stewart is bringing two decades of experience to her new role at BUX."
"Stewart commented: “As BUX enters this new phase of growth, it will be crucial to not only encapsulate the vibrant, start-up culture that has taken shape at the company but to bring it to an elevated level that will continue to attract Europe’s finest talent."
Equally important will be to foster BUX’s existing in-house talent and expertise.”

"The Shaheed Allah Bux Soomro University of Art, Design and Heritage in Jamshoro recently advertised their vacant vice-chancellor position, but they only want male applicants."
"In the latest development, Bux — a startup from Amsterdam that lets people invest in shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without paying commissions (its pricing is based on flat €1 fees for certain services, no fees for others) — has picked up some investment of its own, an $80 million round that it will be using to grow its business."
"“Since we started, Bux has been trying to make investments affordable and intuitive, and that will still be the case,” he said."
"The average age of a Bux customer is 30, so while affordable and intuitive are definitely priorities to capture younger users, it also means that if Bux can earn their loyalty and show positive returns, it has the potential to keep them for a long time to come."
Naeff said in an interview that Bux isn’t disclosing its valuation with this round.
"But for some context, he confirmed that the startup has around 500,000 customers across the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium, using not just its main Bux Zero app, but also Bux Crypto and Bux X (a contracts for difference [CFDs] app)."
Crypto remains a niche but extremely active part of the wider investment market and Naeff described Bux Crypo — formed out of Bux acquiring Blockport last year — as “very profitable.”
"The bigger Bux had only raised about $35 million before this round, and it’s been around since 2014, so while he wouldn’t comment on wider profitability, you can draw some conclusions from that."
"The opportunity that Bux is targeting is a very simple one: Technology, and specifically innovations in banking and apps, have opened the door to making it significantly easier for the average consumer to engage in a new set of financial services."
"Although there is a wave of so-called neobrokers in the market today, Bux’s unique selling point, Naeff said, is the company’s tech stack."
"In comparison to others providing trading apps, he said Bux is the first and only one of them to have built a full-stack system of its own."
“We are excited about backing BUX as they are the leading neobroker in Europe and have been able to build a platform that is sustainable and scalable.
BUX is the only neobroker in Europe that offers zero commission investing without being dependent on kickbacks or payments for order flow.

"Existing investors HV Capital and Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures also participated in the round, showing their commitment to accelerate BUX’s strong, continued growth."

"The institute, led by the award-winning Professor Faizal Bux and assisted by Professor Sheena Kumari, plays a critical role in monitoring and tracking Covid-19 infection spread in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal."
"Professor Bux said the team had used a scientific tool, Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE), which was based on the monitoring and constant analysis of viral particles shed in the stool of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, by examining wastewater from wastewater treatment plants."
"This indicates that wastewater based epidemiology may be used as a predictive tool for surges in COVID-19 infections and that frequent monitoring is required for future wave predictions,” Bux said."
"According to Bux, the technology should be expanded for application at sub-district level by testing sewage from sewer networks servicing suburbs."

This Miniseries will introduce you to the ‘70’s and ‘80’s (or bring back memories) and to an icon of the late 20th century who was both a framer and a product of his time.
"One is your framer, another is your architect and the judge is hearing the case in which you spent way too much on beams, or even worse, your lawyer is going over the damages of cracking and sagging ceilings and walls."
"The state grants a license, upon proof of a rigorous education followed by an internship and one of the longest exams given to show competence, not to your framer, but to the architect."
"Your County Office of Consumer Affairs, which licenses contractors, not framers, can confirm what the qualifications are: no formal educational background, no particular experience, not even an exam."
Your framer gets elevated to the status of a licensed professional by you and you alone.
"He may be smart, even experienced, but the call isn’t for him to make, any more than a couch potato making the calls for a professional football team.There are no consequences for framers whether they’re right or wrong."
"Framers can say anything, and they often do, confusing homeowners into believing their bold, unsubstantiated claims and calling into doubt the designated professional’s judgment or competence."
It sounds more like your framer is flexing his ego to you instead of speaking to the architect.
"Framer, the Amsterdam-based startup behind interactive design platform Framer X, has raised $24 million in Series B investment."
It brings the total raised to date by Framer to $33 million.
"Founded by ex-Facebookers Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk, Framer has set out to ride (and power) a trend that is seeing every company having to become a digital business and often a product-first company, as consumers become accustomed to high-quality apps and other desirable digital experiences."
"To that end, Framer X is described as a “fully integrated design, prototyping and developer handoff tool” that makes it easy to create app designs and prototypes that are as visually polished as a production app."
"Designs created in Framer X are powered by the React framework, and the platform enables a lot of off-the-shelf interactivity, rather than prototypes simply being static wireframes or designs with limited transitions or hotspots."
"However, as explained during a video presentation by Bok and Dijk, what potentially sets Framer X apart from other competing app design and prototyping tools is that you can also import production components and assets into the software for re-use so that designers aren’t continually re-inventing the wheel."
"Via the “Framer X Store,” these React-based components can also come from and be shared by the wider developer community."
"This means that Framer is attempting to be a platform play in the true sense of the word, while in turn the Framer X Store is a clever way of creating network effects."
"Related to this, the company is announcing the beta launch of a private design store for teams on Framer X. The Team Store enables members of teams at the same company to collaborate and share brand assets, design components and more, so as to allow for internal interactive design systems to also live within the Framer platform."
"Those teams are already using Framer X. We are excited about partnering with Koen, Jorn and the Framer team to help make that level of digital product excellence and innovation accessible to any company in any traditional industry, from financial services to retail and beyond.”"
"Meanwhile, the Framer founding backstory is worth noting."
"However, seeing an opportunity to help more companies transition to becoming digital-first and product-led, the pair left to found Framer in 2014."
"Just about any framer, form builder or scaffold erector that has been swinging a hammer as part of his livelihood can tell you that, at some point in their career, they have suffered from joint and muscle pain in their hammering arm."
"Framer X design tool steps in the ring with InVision, Adobe, and Sketch"
"Framer X, a revamped version of three-year-old Framer, was founded by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk after the duo sold design software Sofa to Facebook in 2011."
"Framer X is a rich, React-based design tool that lets any designer draw out their interface components and instantly send them over to the engineering team for collaboration."
"With Framer X, engineers can send over existing components that are in production and let designers move forward from there."
"Framer X also allows users to collect components and other design items as a package within the Framer X store, so that they’re easily accessible during the design process."
Framer X offers a public Framer X Store where casual designers can build off of the experience of advanced designers who’ve uploaded components to the store.
"Framer costs $15/month for users, and private Framer X stores for the enterprise are priced flexibly based on the size of the organization."
"Framer now joins a competitive landscape, which includes the likes of InVision, Adobe, and Sketch."
"Framer has raised $9 million to date from Greylock, Foundation Capital, Designer Fund, and Accel Europe."

"Best for Comfort 4 Dead On DO-FR Framers Rig Photo: amazon.com Check Latest Price One of the main gripes with tool belts is their tendency to sag and shift under the weight of tools, which inevitably causes painful chafing."
"Dead On Tools’ Framers Rig features a substantial set of suspenders with heavy padding that extends from the shoulder blades around the shoulders and across the chest, ensuring you won’t be hiking up your belt every few minutes or suffering from aching shoulders by day’s end."
"Best High-Capacity 5 Bucket Boss Mullet Buster 3 Bag Tool Belt Photo: amazon.com Check Latest Price Carry all the tools you need with this tool belt from Bucket Boss, which boasts 29 pockets with numerous large- and medium-size pouches, which is more than most framers rigs."
"It features three large pockets, each with enough space to carry a framer’s square, a box of drill bits, a screwdriver, a set of pliers, and other hand tools."
"Thus, setting up of these systems involve huge costs, which are difficult for a traditional framer to afford."
Low-code dev platform Framer things it has the answer in its new Playground platform.
"Framer, makers of the low-code development platform Framer X, have announced a new tool to help designers and developers meet in the middle: Framer X Playground."
"Playground is ""the first creative coding environment built specifically with designers in mind,"" said Koen Bok, co-founder and CEO of Framer."
What Framer hopes it can do is further bridge that gap by building an all-in-one development tool with both a code backend and a designer-focused low code environment.
Framer X itself is a low-code tool with a plethora of design elements that can be automatically added to projects.
"One of the key components of Framer X is its built-in store of actual production components, which developers can add for designers to manipulate however they see fit."
"Playground is a supplement to Framer X that Framer believes makes it even better at helping ""product teams around the world understand how to collaborate in new ways, to shorten and refine their product's lifecycle,"" Framer's Addison Schultz said."
"The Framer library is being made open source, which makes frames and stacks easier to implement,"
"Framer X Playground is built on JavaScript ES6 and React, and can also be combined with any other JavaScript framework, so it should be usable for a wide variety of projects."
Bad news for those not operating a Mac-based shop: Framer's software is only available for macOS.
"For those that use Apple hardware Framer X could be an essential tool in connecting developers and design teams, and Playground can make it even moreso."
If you're interested in trying out Framer X and Playground you can download the latest beta version of Framer X (which includes Playground) and give it a try.
"If you decide to stick with Framer X, it will cost you: Individual plans start at $12 USD/month (billed annually), and a group license for five seats is $79 USD/month, also billed annually."
You'll have no issue cranking all settings up high and enjoying stable high framer rates at Full HD.

On-demand digital manufacturing provider Protolabs has revealed that the additional revenue provided by its acquisition of 3D Hubs has aided a return to growth during Q1 2021.
"The company’s decision to buy 3D Hubs has allowed it to reap almost immediate rewards in Q1 2021, increasing the firm’s addressable market by 25%, and its number of unique product developers to 22,605."
"“During the first quarter of 2021, we achieved two very important milestones, the successful launch of Protolabs 2.0 and the transformative acquisition of 3D Hubs, which will enable us to accelerate growth,” said Bodor."
"Although the firm hasn’t broken down exactly how many additive manufacturing-related sales have resulted from its 3D Hubs acquisition, it’s understood to have brought in $5.8 million, potentially making it a significant growth-driver in this area."
"According to Bodor, Protolabs’ acquisition of 3D Hubs in January 2021 enabled it to build “a complementary network of manufacturing partners,” that not only allowed its new subsidiary to generate 35% higher revenue in Q1 2021 than it did in Q1 2020, but to incorporate 3D Hubs’ network of 240 partners and wide machine portfolio into its own, extending its customer reach and manufacturing capabilities."
A further $50 million could also be forked over should 3D Hubs meet targets during the next two years.
Protolabs expanded on its production capabilities by acquiring 3D Hubs in January 2021.
"“We managed our financial performance very well in the first quarter through the Protolabs 2.0 systems launch and acquisition of 3D Hubs,” concluded Way."

"This optimism is also backed by a survey conducted by 3D Hubs that concluded that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, 33 percent of engineering businesses increased their 3D printing usage, and 50 percent of engineering businesses maintained their usage."
"Disruption to overseas sourcing also caused more engineering businesses to consider increasing their 3D printing usage, as lead times for machined and injection moulded parts were too long, and chose either to print in-house or outsource to a local 3D printing company or service bureaus such as 3D Hubs."
About 3D Hubs: 3D Hubs is an online manufacturing platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of manufacturing partners.

"However, due to the popularity of this first exclusive sale with sellers, Catawiki already plans to hold regular exclusive book and manuscript auctions, the next of which will begin November 27 at 10 UTC and will end on December 6 at 18:01 UTC."
"Before that sale, Catawiki will also hold another themed auction from November 13 at 10 UTC until November 25 at 18:01 UTC centering on the works of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda from a collection Harrison calls “one of the most comprehensive to come to market in recent years.”"

An incredibly rare LEGO Inside Tour set and a 40th anniversary LEGO Star Wars model are currently up for auction at Catawiki.
Brick Fanatics has partnered with Catawiki to highlight some of the auction website’s most notable LEGO-related listings.
If you’re looking for a flagship piece for your LEGO collection – the kind that will make your fellow fans green with envy – you could do much worse than checking out what Catawiki has up for grabs at the moment.
"That means they’re pretty much impossible to find on the aftermarket, making the copy up for grabs at Catawiki essentially the LEGO equivalent of the crown jewels."
"You can expect to pay a pretty penny for it as a result, with the current bid standing at €1,200 (and Catawiki’s experts estimating a final sale value of €1,500 to €2,500)."
"Fortunately, you’ve now got another chance to grab a mint-in-sealed-box copy of the showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader – you know, the one that culminated in an intergalactic version of Jeremy Kyle – through Catawiki."

While eBay has moved away from auctions as the core of its services — selling many items and often at “Buy it now” prices — Catawiki has developed an auction-only system that runs like clockwork.
"He says that in tests run by Catawiki, objects that start selling at €1 see much more activity, and ultimately end up at higher prices, than when that same object’s bidding starts at a higher number."
Another area where Catawiki has helped build trust in its platform through its approach to transacting on its site.
"Sellers are vetted by Catawiki, and items are also periodically inspected by experts to assess them as authentic."
"Then, when someone wins an auction, their money is held in escrow by Catawiki until the seller receives and accepts the item."
"Schoenmakers says that while Catawiki was profitable until its Series B — a €10 million investment in September 2014 — it is now in “investment mode,” aka in the red."
"It’s not clear if Catawiki will stick to its structure quite so steadfastly as it grows and competes with more local players, but this is what has helped it get to where it is today, investors say."
"“Catawiki’s curated offering intrigued us, but we were really impressed by the company’s enormous addressable market, highly capital efficient business model and buyers and sellers’ love of the platform as demonstrated through remarkable unit economics."
We look forward to helping Catawiki build a global online auction platform.”
"While a lot of the focus on e-commerce juggernauts in Europe has been around areas like food delivery and the Rocket Internet incubator, Catawiki underscores how online auctions are still alive and well."
"Catawiki may not yet be a household name outside of Europe, but the Accel-backed online auction house is one of the region’s fastest growing startups."

The medals created by the John Jacob Astor Fur Company showed Astor (the company president) on the obverse while the reverse has shaking hands with overlapping peace pipes and tomahawks.
"This privately struck American Fur Company silver peace medal meant to replicate the Peace medals produced by the U.S. government was produced around 1832 and sold for $144,000 on April 22."
A coveted piece from the Donald G. Partrick Collection in Heritage’s April 22 auction in Dallas was the illustrated circa 1832 John Jacob Astor American Fur Company silver medal graded About Uncirculated 55 by Numismatic Guaranty Corp.
This was a privately struck “peace medal” designed to be used as a gift to strengthen ties with North American Indigenous populations.
"The design of the medals was described by Heritage as “a blatant imitation of the standard federal Indian peace medal design,” since the U.S. government was not willing to allow a private commercial entity to issue medals on its behalf."
Contemporary documents establish that the medals were given out by the summer of 1837.
Heritage lists the offered medal as likely the example sold to the Astor Family circa 1893 and later sold at Stack’s John J. Ford Jr.

"Simply put, the importance and historic nature of this remarkable medallic offering cannot be overstated."

Swedish social gaming platform Hiberworld.com announced its first major milestone as the total number of created games on the Hiber platform crossed one million.
"Owned and operated by Hiber, Hiberworld.com allows players to make their own games and 3D experiences, publishing them in minutes without any complex coding."
"“The road to the first million games really began to take shape when we released touch creation on mobile devices in October 2019,” said Mattias Johansson Hiber's chief innovation officer."

European satellite and communications startup Hiber BV has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand its IoT satellite network.
Hiber’s satellite constellation tracks and monitors machines and devices in harder-to-reach places.
"At the same time, co-founder of Hiber Laurens Groenendijk is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives,” the company said in a statement."
"Coen Janssen, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector."
"In particular, because it can reach out-of-the-way areas, Hiber’s network may be able to reduce losses in food production and leakages from oil wells."
This equity financing will help Hiber to enable affordable and ubiquitous connectivity for the IoT solutions.”
"In a unanimous decision authored by Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman and joined by Circuit Judges David S. Tatel and David B. Sentelle, the panel rejected a petition by non-U.S. licensed satellite operators Telesat, Eutelsat, Hiber, Kineis and Inmarsat to vacate the FCC's order."
Hiber has raised $2.25 million in a second round of seed funding for its web platform that makes it easy to create user-generated games.
"The Gothenberg, Sweden-based company has quietly amassed more than 300,000 games from 250,000 monthly active users for its HiberWorld platform."
"“We were coming out at the worst possible time you could,” Hiber CEO Michael Yngfors said in an interview with GamesBeat."
"Hiber isn’t anywhere near as large as Minecraft or Roblox, which are popular user-generated game worlds with users in the hundreds of millions."
And Hiber can target markets with very low bandwidth or low-end computer hardware.
"With the proliferation of HTML5, WebGL, PWA, and WebAssembly, and growing storage capabilities attached to browsers, the core technology to develop and launch HiberWorld has been in place and evolving for a couple of years."
"Then, by saving the location of the assets and their functionality, Hiber can replay them for others on the game portal."
"Hiber has been growing rapidly since adding requested features to its platform, including multiplayer, chat with friends, player homeworlds (personal game spaces), playgrounds (public play spaces), and the capability to play and create your own shooter game."
Sybo CEO Mathias Gredal Nørvig has joined Hiber’s board of directors.
He said in a statement that he feels like Hiber could help change the way a generation communicates through games.
"Yngfors said the name Hiber is a reference to the Latin root of hibernation, or dreaming."
Hiberworld is a web-based platform for creating interactive virtual experiences.
"“This is all thanks to our fantastic community, you continue to amaze us with your creativity,” developer Hiber stated, also saying that it is now adding over 130 new items and 10 new environments to the platform."
"Hiberworld allows users to create their own games, 3D hangouts, playgrounds, interactive scenes, showcases, and virtual worlds without the need to code."
"“The road to the first million games really began to take shape when we released touch creation on mobile devices in October 2019,” Hiber co-founder Mattias Johansson said."
"Hiberworld offers users different social features, including chat, likes, followers, and comments."
"AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dutch satellite Internet-of-Things (IoT) solution startup, Hiber, today announces the launch of HiberHilo, its first end-to-end solution for Oil & Gas Well Integrity Monitoring."
HiberHilo is also the world’s first subscription service for IoT-enabled remote Oil/Gas Well monitoring and the company will be introducing similar services for other specific use cases in 2021.
"Having already been one of the first firms to develop a remote IoT connectivity solution with the launch of its proprietary nano-satellites in 2018, Hiber identified the urgent need for readily available out-the-box end-to-end subscription based offerings."
"The HiberHilo solution for Oil & Gas Well Integrity Monitoring is the first offering of this kind that Hiber will launch because this process is currently complex, time-consuming and expensive (costing up to $40,000 per field visit)."
"HiberHilo’s out-of-the-box subscription solution utilises Hiber’s global satellite network to empower organisations to automate continuous annulus pressure and wellhead monitoring of up to 250 wells in a radius of 10km, even in the most remote locations on Earth."
"Coen Janssen, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Hiber said, “We are excited to launch this first-of-its-kind IoT proposition for remote monitoring at a time when it is needed more than ever."
HiberHilo has already been proven by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) and Royal Dutch Shell (better known as just “Shell”) on an abandoned on-shore well.
"Hiber entered the market in 2018 purely as a connectivity provider, utilising its own proprietary nano-satellite technology to unlock IoT connectivity in the 90% of the world without it."
For more information on HiberHilo visit: hiberhilo.com or watch this video.
"Hiber is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution startup, founded and led by a dream team of satellite experts and tech entrepreneurs."
These 'Hibernauts' are working on a moonshoot goal: to launch and provide end-to-end IoT solutions connected by satellites in space.
More than 55 employees work on the ground-breaking technology behind Hiber and Hiberband at its offices in the Netherlands and USA.
"This has meant that in November 2018 Hiber became the Netherlands’ first commercial satellite company, launching its first two nano-satellites into orbit."
Hiber officially launched at the Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Re:invent Conference in November 2018 where they were named Commercial Startup Launch of 2018 at the AWS conference.
"IoT solutions provider Hiber has successfully launched their 3U cubesat, Hiber Four, onboard SpaceX’s dedicated rideshare mission: Transporter-1."
"“By using our high-performance green propulsion technology, Hiber Four is able to take advantage of the world’s most cost-effective launch whilst maintaining independence and operational flexibility”, said Stefan Powell, CTO of Dawn Aerospace."
"Supported by the European Space Agency and Netherlands Space Office via the ARTES program, Hiber teamed up with Dawn and Hyperion to find a better solution."
"Using this new system, the Hiber Four will swiftly move from its deployed 500 km SSO out to its final 600 km orbit."
Hiber is setting the standard for responsible satellite operations.
"Once on orbit, the Hiber Four can easily avoid space debris, increase its lifetime by raising orbit, and when ready to decommission, Hiber can deorbit within days instead of months."
"Hiber Four is the first of two identical satellites Hiber plans to launch this quarter, with the next one launching on Soyuz."
"These satellites will join the Hiberband constellation to expand offerings to existing customers, particularly those from the oil & gas, transportation and agricultural industries."
"“It is revolutionary to the cubesat market,” said Maarten Engelen, CTO of Hiber."
"A partnership with Hiber, named AWS’ Commercial Start-Up Launch of the Year in 2018 and Dutch National Icon in 2019, shows a promising path forward for sustainability in the Aerospace industry."
"Hiber, a Dutch ‘New Space’ startup, has a new heavy equipment monitoring solution that helps increase productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
HiberHeavy is a subscription-based IoT solution.
"HiberHeavy is a heavy equipment monitoring solution that is subscription-based, easy to install, and operates anywhere in the world."
"With HiberHeavy, mining, agriculture, and construction sites can increase productivity with better data and analytics on their heavy equipment, and is Hiber’s first end-to-end solution for heavy equipment monitoring."
"HiberHeavy helps mining, construction, and agriculture companies to use and manage their heavy equipment fleets to optimize their production."
"HiberHeavy’s solution includes all the hardware and software that a worksite needs to connect its vehicles to a fleet management system at an affordable, subscription-based price."
"The solution uses Hiber’s technology to track vehicle locations, trips, and idle times, anywhere in the world."
"“HiberHeavy is unique because it makes heavy equipment management possible in remote areas of the world through an easy subscription-based model,” says Florian Gendrault, Commercial Director at Hiber."
"“Monitoring in remote areas has generally been too expensive to be a reality, but the SaaS pricing model of HiberHeavy simplifies heavy equipment monitoring and removes risks associated with purchasing new technology.”"
"Companies use HiberHeavy to plan better maintenance schedules, but they can also use it to learn more about how much fuel each vehicle burns while idling."
"“We’re proud to have developed a solution that helps mining companies reduce their carbon footprint through smarter machine monitoring,” says Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder at Hiber."
"Hiber controls the infrastructure of HiberHeavy, including the sensors, dashboard, and data connections."
"Customers have a single point of contact for all of their heavy equipment monitoring needs, and Hiber is responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the hardware and software."
"Hiber BV, a European satellite and communications start-up, has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand the world’s first global IoT (Internet of Things) satellite network."
"Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented, “The €26 million funding is a fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector."
"The European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), the EU’s innovation agency, has awarded Hiber a share of its €278 million Innovation Fund, which will enable the EU to play a prominent role in the global space sector and enhance its autonomy."
Hiber’s in-house-developed satellite constellation will ensure that it is possible to track and monitor machines and devices for a wide range of IoT solutions in some of the world’s hardest-to-reach places.
"Hiber was founded in 2016 to make IoT easy, especially in areas where there is no affordable cellular or WiFi connection."
"Hiber’s scaling of the satellite network and innovative IoT solutions will have significant positive impact on some of the biggest issues facing the world today, from eliminating food wastage to reducing the environmental impact of extracting fossil fuels."
"Hiber revealed Monday the launch of HiberHilo, a subscription-based Internet of Things (IoT) end-to-end solution for oil and gas well integrity monitoring."
Hiber plans to introduce similar services for other specific use cases in 2021.
This is Hiber’s first news release of 2020.
"Hiber launched an IoT network in 2019, following the launch of their 2 satellites in 2019."
HiberHilo uses Hiber’s global satellite network to help customers automate continuous annulus pressure and wellhead monitoring of up to 250 wells in a radius of 10 kilometers.
"Coen Janssen, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at Hiber said, “We are excited to launch this first-of-its-kind IoT proposition for remote monitoring at a time when it is needed more than ever."
HiberHilo has already been proven by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) and Royal Dutch Shell (better known as just “Shell”) on an abandoned on-shore well.
Hiber successfully launches second generation satellite via SpaceX’s Transporter-1
"This European company, Hiber, has successfully launched it’s second generation satellite developed inhouse."
"The new on-board propulsion system allows Hiber’s ground engineers to adjust the satellite’s orbit, safeguarding against collisions and, enabling de-orbit at the end-of-life, making Hiber one of the most responsible CubeSat constellation operators in the world."
Hiber Four is a second generation satellite developed and assembled by Hiber’s engineers in its Amsterdam office.
"Hiber Four, and its sister satellite Hiber Three (launching in March), are half the volume (3U) of the previous generation, which reduces the mass and decreases the launch costs by up to 50 percent."
The newest generation of satellites also have an on-board propulsion system allowing Hiber’s ground engineers to adjust the satellite’s orbit.
"This ensures that Hiber Four, and its future descendants, avoid collisions and, importantly, de-orbit themselves at the end-of-life, making Hiber one of the most responsible CubeSat constellation operators in the world."
"“This is just the start of what’s coming,” says Maarten Engelen, MD Technology and Co-founder at Hiber."
"Unlike the previous generation of satellites, which relied on external development and assembly, Hiber Four was developed in-house by Hiber’s satellite team."
The satellites and Hiber’s end-to-end IoT solutions demonstrate the company’s ability to develop technically complex systems and operate them in the most harsh conditions.
"An example of this technical innovation is Hiber’s most recent product, HiberHilo, a complete end-to-end wellhead pressure and temperature monitoring system for oil and gas companies."
"By moving development in-house, Hiber is able to develop innovative and secure solutions on demand at a faster and more affordable rate, benefitting both its customers and the industry as a whole."
"“Hiber Four is the start of a new era at Hiber,” says Erik Wienk, COO, Hiber."
"“Not only does Hiber Four mean we can give better service levels to our customers, but it also shows what we’re capable of as a team.”"
Hiber Four is the first of two new satellites that Hiber plans to launch this quarter.
"The next satellite, called Hiber Three, will launch in a Soyuz rocket in March 2021."
Hiber Four was launched before Hiber Three because of a delay of the Soyuz launch vehicle.

Entrepreneur-turned- investor Eros Resmini has invested in Swedish UGC platform Hiber through his VC vehilcle The Mini Fund.
"Resmini, who was a co-founder at Discord, and previously part of the management at mobile gaming network OpenFeint, will also join the Hiber board."
"Hiber, which operates the eponymous mobile/PC gaming platform raised additional funding from its seed round participants, including Luminar Ventures, Wild Sloths OY, Bumble Ventures, Konvoy Ventures, GFR Fund, and SYBO."
This takes Hiber’s total funding to-date to $4.5 million.
"“I met the Hiber team in late 2019 and have stayed in touch and followed their progress and execution since,” said Resmini."

Anyone who has had Chinese chili crisp or chili oil will almost undoubtedly become a fan.
"Chili crisp is an infused oil condiment that usually contains crunchy, flavorful bits of peppers, onions or scallions, garlic and other aromatics."
"“Chili crisp,” “chili oil and “chili sauce” can often be used interchangeably, but generally what differentiates chili crisp is the ratio of crispy bits to oil."
"“The chili inside stays crispy, and that’s a large part of the condiment,” said Lucas Sin, chef and owner of Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day Chinese Takeout in New York City, adding that the ratio of crisp to oil is such that you get much more crisp than oil in each spoonful, which creates an addictive texture."
"Lao Gan Ma is the most well-known, mass-produced chili crisp."
"While Huabi made chili crisp famous, similar infused oil condiments have been used in China for centuries."
"Lao Gan Ma is the most well-known, mass-produced chili crisp."
"For example, Sin explained, chili crisps from southern China are often made with spices simmered in oil, leading to “a beautiful, bright red, more rounded mouthfeel to the chili crisp,” whereas chili crisps from northern China are made by pouring hot oil over spices to activate them."
"Many traditional Chinese chili crisps or oils contain ground Sichuan peppercorns, which seduce those who indulge in it with mala: intense heat and numbing sensations that play off each other for a unique sensory experience."
There are countless numbers of chili crisps being sold now in the U.S. Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images
"Fly by Jing Sichuan Chili Crisp is an all-natural chili crisp made in Chengdu, China, adds Sichuan peppers, preserved black beans, mushroom powder and sesame oil for enhanced flavor."
"How to use chili crisp, oil or sauce"
"Chili crisps and oils, while already popular, became even more in-demand during the pandemic, often selling out."
"Now that even more people have experienced Chinese chili crisp, oil and sauce, it’s bound to become a pantry staple."
"There are no hard and fast rules for how to use them, though some chefs recommend using crisps as more of a condiment, while oils and sauces can be used in the cooking process."
"If you’re feeling adventurous, chili crisp is also said to be a great topping for vanilla ice cream, with the sweet and heat working together as a memorable combo."
How to make your own chili crisp or oil
"With so many options on the market that are lovingly crafted by the pros, making your own chili crisp or oil may not be top of mind — but it could be a good way to get creative."
Sin shared his tips for creating chili crisp or oil at home:
"Yes, it is possible to make your own chili crisp at home."
"They are crisp and juicy, laced with ginger and spice."
Sales of Keogh’s Crisps ‘share bag’ have increased by a third during the pandemic.
"“During the pandemic a lot of people have spent more time consuming luxury foods at home and we would be the biggest player in the premium sharing crisp market,” he said."
"In contrast, sales of the company’s smaller ‘impulse’ crisp bag, in service stations and coffee shops “has completely disappeared”."
"Underscoring the increased demand for the farm family owned company’s crisps during the pandemic, Mr Keogh said the company’s production capacity has faced serious tests where some weeks volumes increased by 150 per cent “and we were able to deliver”."
He said Keogh’s is the largest Irish owned player in the crisp market here with about 10 per cent market share.
"Mr Keogh made his remarks when commenting on new abridged accounts showing that Keogh’s Crisps Ltd recorded pre-Covid profits of €99,491 in the 15 months to the end of March 2020."
Signing roundup: Preston Crisp headed to SC State; Benedictine and Johnson athletes sign
"Former Woodville-Tompkins basketball standout Preston Crisp took the road less traveled to achieve his goal, signing two years ago to play junior college ball at East Georgia State in Swainsboro."
"""My time at East Georgia was a learning experience,"" Crisp said."
"Crisp, who was the Savannah Morning News Boys Basketball Player of the Year as a senior at Woodville in 2019, averaged 16 points, seven rebounds and two assists for East Georgia this past season."
"I got a lot stronger and put on some weight (adding close to 25 pounds to reach 200) and became a more versatile player,"" Crisp said."
Woodville coach Lenny Williams said Crisp has what it takes to succeed at the next level.
"NILES — Though he’s a California kid at heart, Northeast Ohio is like a second home to Coco Crisp."
It’s where Crisp began his career in Major League Baseball.
It’s where he began to build his family — Crisp’s oldest child was born in Cleveland.
"So while Crisp admits that he is already homesick (“Family means everything to me, I’m a very blessed man with a great family,” Crisp says), he also is quick to acknowledge that he feels right at home in Niles."
Earlier this week Crisp arrived at what will be his 2021 summer home — Eastwood Field.
"Last month, Crisp was named manager of the Mahoning Valley Scrappers."
"“I have nothing but great memories of my time in Northeast Ohio,” Crisp said."
"Crisp played for the Cleveland Indians from 2002-05, then again in 2016."
"In between those two stints with the Tribe, Crisp played with Boston (2006-08), Kansas City (2009) and Oakland (2010-16)."
"As a youth, Crisp’s introduction into athletics came by way of boxing and karate — sports he learned from his father."
"“It was pretty cool, when you’re a kid and you find something that you’re good at, you tend to stick with it,” Crisp said."
Success followed at the high school level and at Los Angeles Pierce College before Crisp was selected in the seventh round of the 1999 MLB Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals.
"“At each level, I just tried to be the best I could be, I was never looking ahead,” Crisp said."
"Ironically, Crisp’s coaching career has taken a very similar path."
At the end of the 2016 season a number of teams reached out to Crisp seeking his services.
Crisp immediately began coaching his son’s Little League team.
"“Coaching was never a goal, it just happened,” Crisp said."
"Crisp believes that managing this summer in a three-month long MLB Draft League is “the perfect introduction for the next step,” of his coaching career."
"“I’m really a very simple person so being away from my family will be my biggest challenge this summer,” Crisp said."
"Still, Crisp said that fans should expect to see a very competitive Scrappers team this summer."
"“I’m going to let these kids loose, I’m going to take off the shackles and give them the green light,” Crisp said."
This stylish casserole was left at the writer’s house years ago by friends who brought over an apple crisp dessert.
"It was wonderful, an apple crisp, full of flavor with a satisfying crust."
"Months later, there was an article in our paper about making crisps."
"The inside of the crisp was pretty general: Coat the bottom and sides of the baking dish with a bit of butter and add fruit, peeled and cut up into uniform pieces, tossed with a couple of tablespoons of flour, a tablespoon of sugar, and spice if you like it."
Pat the crisp mixture onto the top of the fruit mix

"… Just fast, crisp, in and out of things."
"In the latest twist in this long-running saga, the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina has found the term PRETZEL CRISPS to be generic for pretzel crackers."
The court therefore upheld the decision of the TTAB [here] ordering cancellation of the PRETZEL CRISPS Supplemental Registration.
"The court observed that there was no dispute that the product was ""hugely successful, due in no small part to Plaintiffs' extensive marketing efforts and the PRETZEL CRISPS trademark registration they received and have enforced to clear the field of similarly named products."
"Judge Kenneth Bell first considered whether the combination of the generic terms ""pretzel"" and ""crisps"" creates any additional meaning for consumers from which they can distinguish Plaintiff's product."""
"He concluded that it did not, and therefore that PRETZEL CRISPS is generic."
"Summarizing the evidence on the genericness of the mark, considered as a whole, the Court finds that the combination of the acknowledged generic elements of the compound mark ""yields no additional meaning to consumers capable of distinguishing the goods"" and, independently, usage by competitors, media references and consumer surveys (as well as some use by Plaintiffs) reflects that, on balance, consumers primarily perceive ""pretzel crisps"" to be a common/generic name."

Apps like Polarsteps make it easy to keep track of your entire trip.
"Add photos, text, and points of interest and Polarsteps will do the rest."
This is exactly what Polarsteps makes possible.
"If you are starting with Polarsteps, please add your Polarsteps trip before starting your trip via the Travel tab."
"Once you hit the road, Polarsteps will start tracking your ride."
Polarsteps then asks you to fill in a so-called “step” every time you open the app.
"If you travel regularly and use Polarsteps, you can see exactly which routes you’ve traveled and where you come from most often."
"You can do this by viewing all the steps of your journey, but you can also create a picture book from Polarsteps."
Polarsteps picture book is the only revenue model for the app developed in the Netherlands – the app is free and the developers do not intend to fill the app with ads.
Polarsteps can be downloaded for free from the file Google Play Store On Apple App Store.
What do you think of the concept of Polarsteps?
"Polarsteps just raised a seed round to continue developing its automated travel blogging app, to make the jealousy-machine run just that tiny bit smoother."
"Polarsteps is optimized for travel, which means that you don’t need data roaming or cell coverage to let the app do its thing: GPS works independently of mobile reception and the app synchronizes its data whenever you hit a pocket of cell reception — or when you log in to the Wi-Fi at the hotel at the end of a long, dusty day of travel."
He clarifies that the Beta label reflects that the app currently has a limited feature-set and that it signals that Polarsteps is under active development.
"The implementation of Polarsteps is very well done, but the idea itself is not particularly original: there have been a slew of companies and solutions in this space over the years."
"In particular, the Polarsteps solution has more than a few things in common with esplorio."
"The idea for Polarsteps came to Niek Bokkers, one of the company’s founders, when he set out to sea on a sailing peregrination back in 2013."
"In addition to locations and photos, Polarsteps tracks a ton of other data, including distance traveled, countries visited and more."
Amsterdam-based travel startup Polarsteps allows travelers to share their trips in real time with their closest friends and family.
"The round was led by INKEF Capital, brings Polarsteps’ total funding to date to €4.6 million, after previously raising a €900k seed round in 2017."
"Polarsteps makes money by letting users buy their special “Travel Books”, which are instant photo albums of trips that can be ordered at the push of a button."
Polarsteps’ one million registered users have collectively traveled over 52 million days on the app – shown on a heat map that the company published today.
"Polarsteps co-founder and CEO Koen Droste said: “Being avid travelers ourselves, we founded Polarsteps because we want to inspire and connect people through travel."
"In the coming year, Polarsteps will become the place to go to for planning, tracking and remembering all your trips.”"
"Kyang Yung, Investment Director at INKEF, commented: “The two things that stood out to us about Polarsteps were the virality of the product and a company business model that is global from the get-go."
"The Polarsteps team has the potential to create something truly disruptive in the travel space, and we’re excited to join them on their journey.”"
Over 2.5 million explorers have chosen Polarsteps to create and capture their adventures.
WHAT THE PRESS ARE SAYING ABOUT POLARSTEPS
"""The Polarsteps app replaces your travel journal, making it easier and more beautiful."""
"""Polarsteps helps you track and share your journeys in an easy and visually appealing way."""
"""Polarsteps' resulting travel log is impressive, and is the source of a severe case of itchy feet in your correspondent."""
We'd love to hear what you think about Polarsteps.
"Speaking with Koen Droste, CEO of travel-logging app Polarsteps, he shared that what people will need most is: inspiration, reliable information, and flexibility."
"To help fuel this creative travel energy, Polarsteps recently released a new feature where users can plan their future trips and itineraries."
"The other day on Polarsteps we saw a user who was visiting all the places on the Dutch Monopoly board in order,” Droste told TNW."
"To help solve these problems for their users, Polarsteps wants to create an all-in-one travel platform where travelers can find reliable and high-quality travel information."
Anyone interested in donating can go to wellstrong.org/wellstrong-recovery-ride and can follow along on O’Reilly’s journey at polarsteps.com.
"Once you find cell service and/or an internet connection, Polarsteps syncs up your route, your stops along the way and then geotags your photos, organizing them all on a vivid, shareable map."
"Inkef Capital recently invested in fellow Dutch travel startup PolarSteps, an app that allows travelers to log their trips in real time and share the results with friends and family."
Polarsteps – Travel Tracker We travel for the story and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of where a photo was taken or memory was made.
"Polarsteps documents with geotagging on a map with photos you take that can be shared through your social media or a private link to friends, family and anyone else you want to make jealous that they aren’t on this trip with you."
">>Polarsteps, a trip-tracking app, has raised $3.4 million (€3 million) in Series A funding."
Users of the Polarsteps app can agree to have it automatically track their trip.
"Polarsteps – Imagine having someone following you on your travels, and uploading your notes and pictures on a webpage so your friends and family can follow along."
"Beyond having a single platform to house the “entire travel experience”, Polarsteps is a huge source of inspiration for your next travels."
"If you have ever been in a spot where you chanced upon a new location and could not recall how to go there again, Polarsteps is the right app for you."
"Keeping track of your travel route and places you visit, Polarsteps creates an automatic travel journal for you."
"Portfolio includes: travel app Polarsteps, fashion marketplace The Next Closet and retail tech provider Swogo."
"There are other more specialized apps, like Polarsteps, that help you take a closer look at the exact trajectory of your trips."
"Polarsteps is good for tracking any trip on your mobile device, but if you use it for keeping tabs on the states you’ve visited, you’ll know exactly which ones you set foot in during a particular trip."
"Travel apps, on the other hand like TraveLibro still need catching up from Indian players, at the moment Polarsteps, and Journi, which are travel-based apps based out of the EU are what TraveLibro considers as competition."
With Polarsteps the impromptu becomes the imprinted.

Otrium has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its $26 million Series B round.
The concept behind Otrium is quite simple.
"When items reach the end-of-season status, brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them."
Otrium is currently available in Europe.
"With Otrium, brands can add another sales channel for those specific items."
"And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items, Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies."
The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.
Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time.
"With today’s funding round, Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Joseph, Anine Bing, Belstaff, Reiss and ASICS."
"Dutch end-of-season fashion online marketplace Otrium has bagged US$120 million in its Series C financing round, which will go towards its upcoming U.S. launch and improving its technology platform."
"Otrium, the Amsterdam-headquartered online fashion “outlet” selling unsold end-of-season items, has raised US$120 million in a Series C round co-led by tech venture capital BOND and London-San Francisco investment firm Index Ventures."
Otrium added that the Series C funds will support hiring and the growth of its team.
"Founded by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra in 2015, Otrium, which currently operates in Europe, enables clothing brand partners to sell their off-season inventory in order to avoid unsold fashion items from ending up in the landfills – or in many cases, especially for luxury labels, destroyed or burned in the name of brand exclusivity."
"Milan Daniels, Co-Founder & CEO, Otrium"
"Particularly amid the pandemic, Otrium says that its digital business model, which embeds both convenience and sustainability, has flourished, with its revenues having tripled over 2020 despite the broader economic downturn for high street and brick-and-mortar players."
Otrium sells unsold inventory from partner brands.
"With the fresh capital, Otrium says its analytics functionality can undergo further improvement to help fashion houses figure out past demand trends and future insights, a shift that the firm and its investors believe will shape producers’ strategies and ultimately boost revenues while making a dent on the enormous 92 million tonnes of waste the industry still produces annually."
Otrium’s digital approach has been one that many sustainable fashion players believe will be critical to push forward circularity in the industry.
"With Otrium, every fashion label can begin to build their iconic portfolio.”"
"Retailers are in dire need of sustainable ways to offload and even profit from their excess stock, which is where online fashion marketplace Otrium provides an answer, offering an inventory overflow solution that doesn't end in clothing combustion."
"On the membership side, Otrium prioritizes consumer expectations for excellent service by offering next-day delivery, simplified returns and buyer protection to streamline secure purchasing."
"Otrium is a case study that PSFK analysts noted in research on innovative solutions and strategies for 2020's majorly disrupted and quickly transforming fashion industry—for more, see here."
"Otrium has raised a $26 million Series B funding round (€24 million), with Eight Roads Ventures leading the round."
Otrium works with clothing brands to help them sell items when they reach the end-of-season status.
"Otrium wants to add another sales channel for those specific items — and it’s an online one, which should help when it comes to shelf space."
That’s why Otrium has created a marketplace and tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion brands.
"If you decide to sell end-of-season collections on Otrium, you can manage your own outlet, get in-depth analytics and enable a dynamic pricing engine to maximize revenue on those outdated items."
"Two hundred brands have decided to partner with Otrium, such as Joseph, Reiss, G-Star, Asics, Puma, Vans, Pepe Jeans, Alexachung and Scotch & Soda."
There are one million registered customers on Otrium.
"Dutch app Otrium, which sells unsold stocks of branded clothing, has raised 100 million euros in fresh capital to prepare its planned expansion to the United States."
"Otrium was founded in 2015 by two Dutch entrepreneurs, Max Klijnstra and Milan Daniels, and has grown at lightning speed since then."
"At previous investment rounds, Otrium had already raised 7 million euros (2019) and 24 million (2020)."
"Before creating Otrium, Klijnstra and Daniels already were active in the fashion industry: they sold jumpers with striking prints through Breaking Rocks."
LONDON — The fashion industry’s inventory problem has only gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic and the online designer outlet Otrium — which just got a big cash boost — believes it can help.
"Otrium has already been pushing into key European markets, with a dedicated U.K. site making its debut this week."
"Otrium pitches itself as a tech-enabled, digital solution to make end-of-season selling easier for brands of all sizes."
"The platform sets pricing for products based on variables such as style, number of units and sizes available, and interest from Otrium’s wider community."
"As a result, Otrium chose to operate in “a similar way to a physical outlet but digitized,” making it more accessible to smaller-scale labels that are unable to face the cost — and commitments — attached to physical retail on the platform."
"Once on board, Otrium wants to “share data and convince brands to start making decisions on the basis of data rather than on the basis of trend forecasting.”"
"Otrium, an online fashion marketplace, which sells brands' remaining end-of-season merchandise, on Wednesday announced that it raised €24 million ($26.6 million as of press time) in a Series B funding round, led by Eight Roads Ventures with additional contributions from existing investors Index Ventures and Hans Veldhuizen."
Otrium will use the funding to grow internationally.
"Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Otrium has received ""doubling of interest from brands"" and has experienced a 40% spike in revenue during the past month, according to the company press release."
"Based on Otrium's release, the retailer appears to be positioning itself as a possible solution for offloading the unsold merchandise due to the pandemic."
"""We are focused on onboarding an unprecedented pipeline of brands and we're working on generating revenue for items that would otherwise go unsold,"" Otrium​ CEO and co-founder Milan Daniels said in a statement."
"Earlier this year, Vestiaire Collective received a $216 million investment from Kering and Tiger Global; Dutch online outlet Otrium raised $29 million in the summer of 2020, followed by an additional $120 million last March to fuel U.S. expansion."
"New York – Amsterdam-based online fashion marketplace Otrium has recently secured a 24 million euro Series B financing round led by investors with stakes in other fashion companies such as Alibaba, Farfetch and ASOS."
"Otrium helps global and independent clothing brands sell end-of-season collections that would otherwise go unsold, as the company states on its website."
"Otrium’s fashion marketplace gives retailers full control over price, while they can leverage an array of advanced analytics and insights into dynamic pricing, excess inventory and merchandising."
"In 2015 they launched Otrium, an online marketplace for end-of-season clothes that allows brands to sell their unsold inventory at cheaper prices."
"This is where Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra think they have found a niche in the market with their company Otrium, which raised a €7m Series-A round led by venture capital firm Index Ventures on Thursday."
"In true entrepreneur style, the problem led them to found a company, Otrium, to test out a different approach."
"“Otrium tries to replicate an outlet store, but online,” says Daniels."
"Otrium, which is based in the Netherlands, takes a cut of each sale made on their platform."
"So far Otrium has managed to convince some 100 brands, including names like G-Star, Puma, Vans, Pepe Jeans and Scotch & Soda, to try the approach."
"The money will be used to expand Otrium’s presence across Europe starting with Germany, the UK and France, says Daniels."
"Otrium, an Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based online fashion outlet, raised €7m in Series A funding."
"In conjunction with the funding, Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, joined Otrium’s board."
"Founded in 2016 by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra, Otrium has developed its own model for selling excess inventory."
Many brands have been using brick-and-mortar discount outlets or online marketplaces like the Dutch start-up Otrium to try to shift the designer clothes piling up in warehouses.
"Resale platforms have had no trouble tapping investors, with Vestiaire Collective raising €59 million at the height of the lockdown in April and Rebag raising $15 million in May. Then there’s Otrium, an Amsterdam-based company that promises to help brands sell excess inventory, which raised $26.4 million in May."
"Some, including Otrium, could even thrive as fashion reels from store closures and weak consumer spending."
"“The ability to thrive in this new environment is important to me as an investor,” said Davor Hebel, a managing partner at Eight Roads Ventures, which led Otrium’s latest round of funding."
"Otrium, which lets brands like Scotch & Soda, Reiss, Esprit and Guess sell off their end-of-season product on its platform, fits Hebel’s criteria."
"Online fashion hub Otrium does just this, selling end-of-season collections from retail brands that would otherwise have to destroy their inventory by letting them manage their own outlet, set prices and even access consumer insights."
"In 2020, Eight Roads Ventures Europe invested in Cazoo, Otrium, Spendesk, Odaseva and most recently Tibber, completed eight follow-on investments and exited Rimilia."
5) Fashion marketplace Otrium nabs $120 million
"Amsterdam-based unsold fashion marketplace Otrium has raised $120 million in a fresh round of funding co-led by BOND and Index Ventures, and saw follow-on investment from Eight Roads Ventures."
"The series C round is expected to propel Otrium’s entry to the US market, ramp up additional unsold fashion capabilities, and recruit new staff."
Thrilled to double down on our partnership with @OtriumOfficial and co-lead their $120M Series C with BOND!
"As expected, several notable companies have made it to the list, which includes companies such as 3D Hubs, MessageBird, Otrium, Picnic, Recruitee, The Next Ad and Zivver."
"“Fashion brands struggle with an abundance of excess inventory collecting dust in a warehouse,” explains Otrium’s cofounder Milan Daniels, 26."
"Launched two years ago by Daniels and Max Klijnstra, 27, Otrium is effectively Shopify for fashion brands, providing the e-commerce technology stack and logistics handling to create online outlet/clearance stores."
"Claiming 300,000 users and 60 brands across Benelux countries, Otrium recently raised €750,000 (£662,000) – bringing total funding to €1.6 million (£1.4 million) – to fuel international expansion."
"Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack now compete with resale platforms such as The RealReal and Poshmark and newer ventures like Otrium and Madaluxe Vault — which Freede launched in recent years to sell excess designer items to consumers directly — that put their own spin on the off-price model."
"Otrium, a five-year-old company based in Amsterdam, operates a marketplace where brands can sell their surplus directly to consumers, which it says offers higher margins than the wholesale market."
Otrium co-founder Milan Daniels told BoF his company offers prices to sellers that are three times as much as other stock buyers.
"One of Gapstars clients is Otrium, a fast-growing tech company and a fashion e-commerce platform that enables the World’s leading fashion brands to find buyers for clothing unsold at stores."
"Otrium has secured over $30 million in funding, including $24 million Series B funding in mid-2020 at the height of the global pandemic."
Otrium will use the funding to grow internationally.

"“Great examples of startups in our space that are well on their way to doing that are Connecterra, who are on a mission to make global agriculture more productive and sustainable using sensors and artificial intelligence, and No Isolation, who builds robots designed to reduce social isolation in vulnerable groups in society,” Nijssen added."
"For example, Senseye helps manufacturers prevent machine downtime through predictive analytics, FoodMarble has produced a smart device that can help people with digestive problems and Connecterra has developed a wearable device for cows that improves the productivity of the herd."
"For example, Connecterra, an Amsterdam-based startup, uses Google AI to create digital sensors that farmers can use to monitor their livestock’s movement and eating habits."
"Connecterra actually pays Microsoft to rent cloud storage, the main way Google hopes to cash in on its AI tools."
"The Alpha award, for those with less than $500,000 in funding, was won by Connecterra, a company that provides location and monitoring services for dairy cattle."

"The top two based on market share are North American leader ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) and leading European provider EVBox, which will soon go public through a merger with SPAC TPG Pace Beneficial Finance (NYSE: TPGY)."
Company 2021 Revenue Estimate (millions) 2020 Revenue (millions) ChargePoint $200 $146 EVBox $145 $84 Volta $47 $25 EVgo $20 $14 Blink Charging NP* $6.2
Both ChargePoint and EVBox have more established and diversified networks.
"EVBox has sold more than 235,000 charge ports, the most of any company."
The business combination bringing EVBox public is expected to close in June 2021.
"Based on the valuation initially presented when the merger was announced, EVBox would have a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion at the current share price."
"That makes EVBox clearly cheaper on a price-to-sales basis, as ChargePoint's market cap is approximately $6.5 billion."
The most concerning news is that the TPGY/EVBox SPAC deal may fall apart.
Potentially the biggest SPAC news today is that the TPG Pace Beneficial (TPGY) / EVBox merger may be falling apart.
It plunged -12.5% following an 8-K that called doubt as to whether their deal with EVBox will ultimately be completed.

"“In order to be able to assist our customers with all manner of questions concerning planning, application and implementation processes concerning charging infrastructure, as well as with connection to the electrical network, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE and EVBox Group,” continues Wallfeld."
"If the customer makes use of the services provided by Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE or EVBox Group, these partners will look after the analysis of the depots and the establishment of suitable infrastructure and energy supply, together with intelligent hardware and software-based charging solutions."
"Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE and EVBox Group collaborate closely with Mercedes-Benz Trucks in all phases of the process."
TPGY and EVBox haven’t set a firm date for their merger closure.
EVBox also gave TPGY the right to terminate the agreement at any time during the 15 business days following the date on which EVBox delivers the audited financial statements for 2020 to TPGY.
"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday broke down three companies that fell into the charging-station category, concluding that the one investors should be most interested in is EVBox."
Netherlands-based EVBox's deal with the SPAC is expected to close late in the first quarter of this year.
"""If you want a charging station play, EVBox seems like the best of the bunch — very similar to ChargePoint but with a faster growth and a cheaper stock,"" Cramer said Monday."
"Both EVBox and California-based ChargePoint sell hardware and offer a software-as-a-service component, Cramer said, helping other entities build charging stations at their parking spaces."
"One of the biggest differences between the companies is that EVBox started in Europe, where it's the market leader, before expanding in the U.S., Cramer said."
"For the current year, ChargePoint projects revenue growth of about 50% compared with 2020 figures, while EVBox is forecasting sales to increase by about 72%, according to Cramer."
"Cramer said Los Angeles-based EVgo is ""higher risk, higher reward"" for investors because it's earlier in its life cycle than EVBox and ChargePoint."
"It is taking EVBox, a Dutch maker of charging stations, to the NYSE next month."
"On the close of the deal, EVBox will trade under the symbol EVB."
"Second, EVBox is more than hardware."
"This means EVBox has multiple revenue streams – hardware, software, and services."
"The deal, first announced in December, will deliver $425 million to EVBox, implying a value of $969 million."
"If I were to pick between ChargePoint and EVBox, I go with EVBox, because the software and services mean continuing revenue."

Amsterdam-based CodeSandbox has raised $12.7 million to help teams collaborate on the development of web-based applications.
"“We want to expand our use cases for CodeSandbox,” CEO and cofounder Ives van Hoorne said."
CodeSandbox is part of a broader move to simplify coding and make it more accessible — commonly referred to as “low code” or “no code.”
"It’s a big trend, which means CodeSandbox will also face some tough competitors, like Airtable, which recently raised $185 million at a $2.585 billion valuation."
"Founded by van Horne and Bas Buursma in 2017, CodeSandbox bridges the collaboration and low-code elements by creating a browser-based service."
"While there are web-based tools for individual coders, CodeSandbox is expanding this idea by making projects available to teams."
CodeSandbox says its more than 2.5 million monthly users have together created over 10 million projects on the platform.
"While CodeSandbox has so far focused on collaboration, the upcoming Pro Workspaces product will introduce features that make projects accessible to non-developers."
"The data being crunched highlighted CodeSandbox’s early seed investment, as well as factors like its rapidly growing user base, prompting partners to reach out to the company before it was looking to raise money."
"In talking with EQT, van Hoorne said he was surprised how much the firm’s partners seemed to know about CodeSandbox’s business."
"“We were happy to see the fruits from our data-driven proactive approach with CodeSandbox,” EQT analytics partner Henrik Landgren said."
"Motherbrain also helped us to find and compare the various other related companies, which made us even more excited about CodeSandbox.”"
"CodeSandbox, a Dutch startup that enables developers to create a web app development sandbox in the browser, has officially launched a collaborative platform that allows teams to collaborate on code in the cloud."
"Up until now, CodeSandbox was mainly focused on individual users, with developers often using CodeSandbox in their own time and then attempting to use it with team members at work."
A key selling point of CodeSandbox is that it is cloud native — the company hasn’t just transported a local development environment and stuck it on the cloud.
"This “web-first” approach means CodeSandbox is “faster, more collaborative, and easier to use,” CEO Ives van Hoorne said in a press release announcing the launch."
"The fact that everyone in a product team can use CodeSandbox means developers can comment on each other’s code, designers can pitch in with feedback on the UI, and marketers can review the copy."
"From the get-go, CodeSandbox has been vocal about its plans to support teams."
"Before Team Pro, the platform did actually offer a workspace feature so its customers could use CodeSandbox in groups — but this was intended only for public sandboxes, which effectively meant open source software."
There are some clear synergies between Figma and CodeSandbox in terms of how they enable app prototyping in the browser.
"In fact, Figma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field is an investor in CodeSandbox."
"Founded out of Amsterdam in 2017, CodeSandbox has raised around $15 million in funding, including a $12.7 million series A round just a few months ago from Kleiner Perkins and other investors."
It’s free to use CodeSandbox although there are a few minor limitations.
"If I tie my CodeSandbox account to GitHub, for example, all of my code will be public."
"In fact, CodeSandbox is built on Visual Code and includes code auto-complete suggestions:"
This lets you collaborate with everyone running CodeSandbox in their own browser.
Using CodeSandbox it was easy to complete the assignment right in my Chromebook browser.

"CodeSandbox also sands off some of the rough edges of configuration files and has a lot of premade projects built with various technologies (React, Vue, Redux, and even exotic frameworks like Hyperapp), which makes it easy to get started with the uber-complicated build chain that modern web development seems to require."
And I was extra excited to see that CodeSandbox has a Vim mode.
"CodeSandbox was all I needed, and my iPad was suddenly an ultra useful webdev box — at least for building the sort of small experiments I gravitate toward."
"Many Vim users (like myself, for instance) map a fancy key combo like “jj” to make exiting insert mode easier, but CodeSandbox isn’t actually Vim."

The seed round brings Kambr’s total funding to $7 million following an investment of $4 million announced in September 2019.
Netherlands-based Kambr plans to use the funds to accelerate product development.
"Scheeringa, co-founder of SAR Trilogy Management and former-CEO of Flight Options between 2004 and 2008, says: “A key differentiator of Kambr is the focus on total commercial optimization of a customer versus fare-based revenue management."

"In a time when much of the industry has been curtailed, travel-tech startup Kambr has continued to grow through customer acquisition, funding and personnel additions despite the global pandemic and air travel demand shock."
"Kambr closed its latest seed round of $3 million, bringing the travel-tech startup’s total funding to $7 million."

Kambr also announced the hiring of Sean Moriarty as its Chief Technology Officer.
"Leaving his 14-year tenure at Revenue Management Systems - An Accelya Group Company, Moriarty comes on board to accelerate innovation, as Kambr continues to lead airlines to new levels of productivity and performance for their revenue analysts."
"“I’ve seen firsthand how frustrating it can be when airlines feel like they are not getting ahead of the curve, so I find Kambr’s trailblazing approach to be very refreshing and necessary.”"
"Moriarty will lead Kambr’s growing development team, working closely with co-founder Michael Peters, applying their product and industry acumen to deliver revenue management solutions that un-constrain revenue analysts, freeing up time so they can do more meaningful, revenue generating work at a fraction of the cost."

"Therefore, it was easy to make a decision because Kambr is willing to apply their expertise to fit our specific needs."
One of Kambr’s unique selling points is its product’s ability to seamlessly plug into an airline’s existing tech stack instead of uprooting entire systems.
“Kambr has a strong product vision which fits well with our strategic objectives.
"In addition, we highly value the Kambr team’s expertise and support.”"

"Kambr’s Advisory team worked closely with AirAsia’s revenue analyst team through the remote technology setup and configuration to create an optimal workflow and process improvement, considering the airline’s business practices and commercial objectives."
"Together we’re building the future for commercial airlines, ushering in a new era of efficiency, collaboration and intelligent automation,” said Jason Kelly, CEO, Kambr."
"Kambr, Inc., a global provider of a commercial airline intelligence platform, closed a $4M seed funding round."

"Commercial airline intelligence platform Kambr Inc. has officially launched with the closing of its $4M seed funding round, as the online and travel tech marketplace is poised to reach $1 trillion with 11 percent annual growth rates."

"On the other hand, startup revenue management players, notably Connecticut-based Kambr and San Francisco-based Flyr, are nimbler, he said, and their new systems can more readily adapt to real-time changes in market conditions."
Evidence that at least some airlines are noticing such a difference can be found in the success Kambr and Flyr have had in signing up clients over the course of the pandemic.
"The first airline customer for Kambr's Eddy revenue management solution went live 10 months ago, the company's managing director, Chris Anthony, said."
Kambr's largest client so far is discount carrier AirAsia.

"SurveyMonkey announced today that it has acquired Usabilla, an Amsterdam-based website and app survey company, for $80 million in cash and stock."
"Zander Lurie, CEO at SurveyMonkey, said Usabilla filled in a missing piece in its survey toolkit."
Usabilla CEO Marc van Agteren says his company is adding a complementary product to SurveyMonkey.
"For example, if there is a bug on the page, the user can click the Usabilla tool, capture the area of the page that’s problematic as a screenshot and send it with a comment to the website or app owner for review."
"With Usabilla, SurveyMonkey gains a stronger foothold in the EU as the company’s headquarters in Amsterdam will become the SurveyMonkey’s largest EU office."
"In addition, it can now access Usabilla’s 450 customers, which include Lufthansa, Philips and Vodafone."
"Lurie said there is some customer overlap, but given that the majority of Usabilla’s customers are outside the U.S., there would likely be a net customer gain from the purchase."
Usabilla was founded in 2009 and raised a modest $1 million along the way.

"“Usabilla’s deep expertise helping top global brands improve their products and customer experiences is perfectly aligned with our mission, and together, we will deliver significant value to our enterprise customers and shareholders.”"
"“To put the customer at the center and make smarter business decisions, more firms are leveraging VoC technologies to get to rich, meaningful, and contextual insights,” said Faith Adams, senior analyst, Customer Experience at Forrester that included Usabilla as a VoC specialist in their 2018 Now Tech report . “Achieving best-in-class customer experience (CX) requires firms to extend their efforts beyond a specific channel or line of business."

"The company said its Lieferando service, which operates in 50 German cities, would now also offer groceries."
"Lieferando ""intends to run its grocery business at gross profit neutral,"" Takeaway said in a statement."
"""It is much nicer to do this job now than when there was snow on the ground,"" Miguel laughs, as he cycles through a leafy Berlin park by the river under the midday May sun, clad in the ubiquitous bright orange Lieferando delivery uniform."
"As soon as the app is activated, Miguel, who did not want to use his real name, is also handing over his phone's GPS information to supervisors and managers of Lieferando."
The app tells him that he was three minutes late in the delivery; another data point that will be saved for the managers of Lieferando to examine if they wish.
"Miguel is one of 5,000 new delivery drivers that Lieferando, Germany's biggest food delivery service, hired since the first lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020."
"But in a statement to DW, Lieferando denied misusing drivers' data: ""It is needed to assign orders to drivers and for the 'food tracker' feature that allows restaurants and consumers to check the status of their order."
"Konstantin, aged 32, moved from his home country Greece to Berlin last year to kick off a career in web development and has worked for Lieferando part-time since March."
Lieferando is the most popular food delivery service in Germany
"It is impossible to estimate an average salary for Lieferando drivers in Berlin, as so many work only for a few hours a week, but for someone like Miguel it gives him a little over €1,000 a month."
But Lieferando is only one of many delivery companies out on the streets of Berlin.
"Unlike Lieferando, many of these do not directly employ workers, instead contracting them out through third parties."
"""Lieferando will do just about the minimum that is allowed under German law in terms of data security, payments and workers' rights,"" Miguel added, shrugging."
"Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway, a food ordering and delivery company, has announced that it would launch a supermarket delivery service in Germany via its Lieferando.de service."
"Just Eat Takeaway also mentions that its Lieferando service, which operates in 50 German cities, would also offer groceries."
Lieferando is a mobile app to order food online from restaurants.
"While it operates as Just Eat in the UK, Takeaway.com leads in the Netherlands and it is Pyszne in Polish (Delicious) and Lieferando in German – all shaped by a patchwork of acquisitions throughout the years."
"Top Companies in the Global Takeaway Food Delivery Market are – Pizza.de, Lieferheld, Lieferando.de, Takeaway.com, Delivery Hero2020-2025"
"At worst, the startup will be successful enough at growing its business so as to become an acquisition target when the market starts consolidating, as when the likes of Delivery Hero and Lieferando were acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in Germany."
"It just so happens that some takeout orders may make you happier than others, at least, that's what an experiment conducted by the German food delivery app Lieferando suggests."
"The team at Lieferando studied 2,158 people throughout 2020 and analyzed their emotional reactions to 11 different types of cuisine ordered for takeout."
"According to Lieferando, ordering Chinese cuisine boosted happiness levels by as much as 58%."
But the real dagger came last December when the Dutch food delivery giant Takeaway.com — known in Germany as Lieferando — effectively tied up the German food delivery business for itself with its purchase of Delivery Hero's extensive operations in the country for $1.1 billion (€990 million).
"Takeaway.com, which goes under the Lieferando brand in Germany, has effectively got the German online food delivery market all sewn up with the departure of Deliveroo"
"Delivery Hero, which owned the long established order-platforms Lieferheld, Pizza.de and Foodora, was locked in a battle for supremacy with Lieferando."
Any hopes Deliveroo had of muscling in on the duopoly were effectively dashed by the December deal which saw Lieferando take over Delivery Hero's operations.
"That model still accounts for around 95% of all food deliveries, with much of Lieferando's business operating that way."
"Lieferando, Pizza.de, Lieferheld, lieferservice.de, Deliveroo and Foodora all battled it out to win the right to deliver Germans dinner."
"“Now there’s only one brand left, which does marketplace delivery,” he says — Lieferando, as Takeaway.com’s German operation is known, connects customers with restaurants which mostly fulfil deliveries using their own delivery drivers."
"The deal covers all of Delivery Hero’s operations in Germany, which include the Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora brands, which will now merge with Takeaway.com’s Lieferando.de brand."
"He's working for the tech company Lieferando, delivering food from restaurants to customers' homes."
"Takeaway.com — the parent company of Lieferando, which dominates the web-based food delivery market in Germany — responded to the outbreak by issuing a statement to its customers and workers in Europe."
"The precaution is not a requirement, however, and cash delivery was still available on Lieferando's website at the time of publication."
"The hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant is behind the curve, but they've started the process of registering with the delivery platform Lieferando."
"German fast food delivery portal Lieferando has started accepting Bitcoin for orders, as the first player in the industry to do so."
"As part of a package of updates released to users this week, Lieferando, owned by the international umbrella company Takeaway.com, added Bitcoin for all its partner restaurants."
The new payment method is available on both Lieferando’s website and via its app.
"Jitse Groen, founder and CEO of the Germany-based food delivery service Takeaway (Lieferando.de), announced on March 18 that his company had suffered a DDoS attack."
"@thuisbezorgd @lieferando @pysznepl pic.twitter.com/YMwSJUOoJn — Jitse Groen (@jitsegroen) March 18, 2020"
"Shortly after Groen issued his tweet, Lieferando.de tweeted out its own disclosure about the attack."
"https://t.co/2m00je8xHe — Lieferando.de (@lieferando) March 18, 2020"
Some customers responded to Lieferando.de’s tweet with complaints that the company had accepted new orders despite its systems being unavailable due to the DDoS attack.
"Under these conditions, many Germans order in through food delivery services like Takeaway.com (Lieferando.de)."
"Lieferando boasts food delivery from more than 15,000 restaurants in Germany, so the impact of a DDoS attack is significant; not just for customers but for restaurant owners, too."
"At the time of publishing, Lieferando website was up and running."
"In recent years it has acquired Berlin-based food ordering startup Lieferando and Delivery Hero’s German food delivery businesses Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora."

"The bundle's featured game is Liyla And The Shadows Of War, a survival story game about a girl living in Gaza in 2014, made by Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh."
"There are hundreds of other games included too, such as Pikuniku, Minit, Signs Of The Sojourner, Moon Hunters, Glittermitten Grove and VVVVVV - and those are just a few highlights from a quick scroll on the bundle's main page."
"You can buy the Indie bundle for Palestinian Aid on Itch.io for a minium price of $5 (about £3.70), though you can choose to pay more if you want."
"At the time of writing, the bundle has raised over $598,000 (roughly £424,000), well over its initial $500k goal."

"From a hardware perspective, it delivers, especially if you get the Fire HD 10 Plus Productivity Bundle, which has the HD 10 Plus' extra gigabyte of RAM."
"This feels like a missed opportunity for the Fire HD 10 Plus Productivity Bundle in particular, since the Fire HD 10 Plus has wireless charging."
"This bundle's other substantial addition is a yearlong subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal, which would otherwise cost $69.99."

"Running throughout the week, the Palestine bundle follows in the footsteps of last year's Bundle for Racial Justice, which raised over $8.5 million for legal defence funds in the US."
The centrepiece of the bundle is Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh's Liyla and the Shadows of War.
"Like last year, buying the bundle will also send you a link to a page full of downloads, rather than flooding your itch library with 1,019 games all at once."
"With three days still to go, here's hoping the bundle can cross the million mark before the end of the week."
It's also welcoming to see that last year's bundle wasn't just a one-off.

And it looks as though Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is set to be the first game bundled with a PS5.
French news site Station of Play tweeted images of what looks to be a hardware bundle Sony is expected to release on the same day.
"If this bundle launches in the US, the price is likely to be closer to $570, although the chances of actually securing one is going to be low due to demand and will come down to pure luck in most cases."
"Sales of the PS5 are thought to be double that of the Xbox Series X and Series S, and this bundle will surely help to at least maintain that lead for Sony."
"State of Play also claims France has been allocated up to 12,000 units of the bundle, which if true, will likely be mirrored across other countries in Europe."

Cleeng offers a customer insights tool called ChurnIQ that's focused on the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) market—ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) is on the road map—that provides answers for questions like this.
Cleeng has examined nearly a decade's worth of data to find metrics that correlate strongly with performance outcomes.
"""We focus on two different ideas: the overall product usage model and engagement at the individual level,"" says Damien Organ, senior product designer at Cleeng."
"While there are many types of relevant KPIs, Cleeng recommends that most companies focus on these four:"
"""For Cleeng clients we find similar outcomes, with an average of around 65% of trials converting overall, and top performers converting at 75 to 80%,"" the report notes."
"ChurnIQ is available standalone or as part of Cleeng's subscriber management platform, and pricing varies according to audience size."

The additional funding strengthens Cleeng’s leading position in the Direct-to-Consumer video industry.
"“The OTT market is booming, and this investment will allow us to reinforce our core competencies and create the best platform for broadcasters to succeed in delivering Direct-to-Consumer strategies”, said Gilles Domartini, founder and CEO of Cleeng."
"Vincent Gravesteyn, Managing Director at Walvis, commented “Cleeng’s team has built a highly reliable and technically advanced video e-commerce platform for the broadcasting ecosystem."
Cleeng’s innovation in this space offers valuable opportunities for business efficiencies”.

"Cleeng was founded in 2011 by former Apple, Philips and NEC e-commerce and media experts."
"Gilles Domartini, chief executive and founder of Cleeng, offers his take on the ever-growing world of over-the-top (OTT)."
"At Cleeng, we opted for a video focused, data-driven, 360 degree take on churn and identified three major groups of churn generators: payment, engagement, and satisfaction."
"The product itself called Cleeng ChurnIQ empowers OTT broadcasters to tackle churn at all the phases of the customer journey, from login to payment, consumption, ending with customer care."
"That’s why Cleeng is the preferred tech partner to many leading sports brands and suppliers, like Ostmodern, Maestro.io, Brightcove etc."
"In a recent example, SportsMax, the leading sports broadcaster in the Caribbean, set up a dedicated sports channel with Cleeng and broadcasted all the live games via a streaming app."

Subscriber retention management (SRM) solutions provider Cleeng has announced the launch of a new analytics suite.
"Gilles Domartini, CEO and founder of Cleeng, said: “Subscriber retention management is at the heart of our strategy."
"Cleeng will be showcasing the SRM dashboard IBC 2019 in Hall 21, stand 14."
"The company says that it will help provide a consistent user experience across all devices, the flexibility to easily expand and customize functionality, and integration with the Verizon Media Platform as well as with other members of the Verizon Media extensions programme, such as Cleeng, which handles authentication, user management and entitlements."
"“The first challenge is to build premium content … it has to be very unique,” says Gilles Domartini, chief executive and founder of Amsterdam-based Cleeng, a web service provider that helps publishers put up paywalls or registration gateways around their content."
VentureBeat worked with Cleeng early in 2012 to present a five-question registration form to readers before letting them watch a live video webinar.
(Disclosure: Cleeng provided the service to us for free so that we could review it.)
"“By deploying the Cleeng solution, the conversion rates from the webinar were much higher than normal, and completion rates for the registration form were close to 100 percent,” VentureBeat’s director of marketing and ad operations Garrett McCullum told me."
"In addition to video, Cleeng can also provide paywall-restricted access to HTML pages, PDF files, and a variety of other content — and it can do so on a wide range of platforms, including HTML5-based mobile websites."
"One of Cleeng’s selling points is the simplicity of its user interface, a design aesthetic that, Domartini says, stems from his experience working for Apple."
"So when he came to start Cleeng, he said, “we started from the user standpoint and thought, what do we need to do to have a technology that would work on any device, for any content, and it would ‘just work,’ from the user perspective.”"
Cleeng integrates with WordPress (as a plugin).
"Cleeng also provides content paywall services to video publishing platforms, including Dailymotion, Brightcove, and Livestream."
Cleeng was founded in 2011 and currently has 12 employees.
"Meanwhile, MXGP’s newest partner, Cleeng, will manage the e-commerce activities on MXGP-TV and will also provide customer support, with anything MXGP-TV related."

"Gilles Domartini, Cleeng CEO and Founder: “We are thrilled to support MXGP TV’s Direct to Consumer’s strategy, and partner with StreamAMG."
"MXGP TV is leveraging Cleeng’s full SRM stack, so to provide a frictionless and cost-efficient user experience, from identity & offer management, payment and tax handling in many countries, as well as multilingual customer care experiences."
"Cleeng, a WordPress plugin that lets anyone from casual bloggers to professional publishers charge for whole articles, parts of articles or indeed any element of a page, is now out of private beta and taking sign-ups from the public."
"As we reported last month, Cleeng lets its users offer a “halfway-house” between a free website and a paywalled one."
"Cleeng focuses on small payments, allowing publishers to charge between $0.15 and $0.99."
"Netherlands-based Cleeng says that it has already attracted 200 content producers, including 40 publishers, and is in discussions with several major European newspapers and magazines to provide content monetization solutions for their websites."
"For an example of how it works, take a look at this page and scroll down the Cleeng-branded section."
Cleeng’s approach of “teasing” content is interesting as it allows publishers to easily tweak exactly how much content they monetize.
"The “tease” approach may frustrate and drive away readers unwilling to pay, of course, so getting that balance right will be key to making a success of using Cleeng on a website."
Cleeng is open for publishers to sign up to today.
The event will be streamed exclusively via online sports broadcaster Cleeng with a PPV listing of AU$30.00.

"ParkBee was founded in 2015 in the Netherlands and has offices in Amsterdam and London, employing 50 people in all."
The app allows drivers to locate and reserve available spaces in off-street car parks and be directed to those spaces through the ParkBee app and affiliates such as Google Maps.
"With full responsibility for the leadership and development of ParkBee in London, De Rauville will play a key role in meeting the company’s ambitious growth goals in London and the UK."
"She said: “As one of the world’s first digital car park operators, ParkBee’s aim is linking drivers to convenient off-street parking locations while helping property owners and local authorities to make better, more efficient use of existing urban space."
"By optimising existing car parking, ParkBee creates more room in towns and cities for people and maximises revenue for landlords and tenants.”"
We do not see any impediments to achieve our goal and we are looking forward to this next stage in the ParkBee journey as we roll-out our strategy in this region.”
"Werner Paul Boerma, CEO ParkBee: “Angelique’s track record, international experience, and management skills are impressive, so we are thrilled having her on board."
We are convinced she will effectively lead our team in London and realise our intended expansion in the UK together with the great team that has already proven ParkBee is in an excellent position to create substantial value for real estate owners and consumers.
"ParkBee optimises occupancy rates in parking locations through data and smart technology for reservations, dynamic pricing and direct integration in large parking and mobility platforms of, amongst others, Parkmobile, Yellowbrick and ANWB."
"ParkBee, a Netherlands-founded startup that lets private car parks monetize underutilized spaces by making them bookable to the public, has picked up €5 million in new funding"
"Originally launched in Amsterdam in early 2016 where it now has over 60 parking locations, ParkBee says the new capital will be used for further U.K. expansion after the burgeoning company recently brought its offering to London."
"Specifically, this consists of hardware ParkBee had to develop that is retrofitted to a private car park’s existing barrier or security system."
"“Parking is an enormous hassle in every large city, and streets are only getting fuller, whilst the parking capacity is there but not yet accessible for the general public,” ParkBee commercial director Wouter de Bruijne tells me."
ParkBee opens up these locations to the public”.
"To that end, the list of private property companies ParkBee is already working with include JLL, BT and local councils in the U.K."
"Meanwhile, the ParkBee business model is straightforward."
ParkBee is a digital car park operator with a clear goal.

"With in excess of 60 locations in the Netherlands and over 20 locations opened in the last months in the UK, ParkBee has proven its potential, by using smart technology that enables users to open up the barriers and doors from the RingGo and Parkmobile apps."
"Tom Buchmann, Co-Founder and Managing Director of ParkBee, commented: “‘It’s hard to believe that there are so many unused parking spaces in London, whilst parking in London is such a hassle."
The ParkBee technology is fully compatible to any parking system and provides seamless entry for the consumer.
"ParkBee installs it’s smart hardware at the location and via their integrated software the location can be opened remotely via the Parkmobile and RingGo apps –in the UK alone, RingGo has 12 million registered users."
The real-estate owner keeps control and can still manage the availability and ParkBee will optimise the occupancy of the location.
"Stefan Hülsen, Senior Investment Manager at Statkraft Ventures, said: “ParkBee is a fantastic example of a company providing a solution to a problem witnessed in many cities and large towns."
By making optimal use of the parking spots that are already available ParkBee opens-up new opportunities to park.
"ParkBee is a prime example of a company enabling cities to become smarter and fairer, while empowering citizens and businesses to improve and solve a problem.”"
Founded in 2013 in the Netherlands by Jian Jiang and Tom Buchmann ParkBee aims to fix the problem of parking in big cities through technology.
"In London alone, according to a study commissioned by Transport for London*, there are over 1 million private parking spots, with the value of a 20-spot garage hitting easily £50,000 in annual revenue for the owner (based on calculations made by ParkBee)."

"Owlin, a startup we covered all the way back in late 2012, has raised $3.5 million in Series A funding."
"The investment will enable Amsterdam-based Owlin to accelerate its growth internationally, especially in the U.K. and the U.S. The company’s international clients include Fitch Ratings, Adyen, Deutsche Bank, ING, and KPMG."
"“We started with delivering news signals to dealing room environments with our platform,” Owlin co-founder and CEO Sjoerd Leemhuis recalls."
"This is seeing Owlin enable 15,000 counter-party risk managers worldwide to track risk events that are not captured by traditional credit risk metrics."
"In the end, our clients don’t just gain insights, they also gain time,” adds the Owlin CEO."
"Meanwhile, Owlin’s Series A isn’t just a lesson in finding market fit but also in tenacity."
This left Owlin falling back on a bootstrap strategy and being extremely cautious when choosing a next investor.
"Owlin, an Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based AI-driven text and news analytics platform for the financial industry, secured $3.5m in funding."
"Led by Sjoerd Leemhuis, CEO, Owlin provides a natural language text and news analytics platform to monitor the user’s environment proactively, continuously and in real-time."
"Clients use Owlin for business opportunities, risk management, research or leveraging their business case by integrating the platform with their end user solutions."

4. Resorting to owling to relieve tension
Owling is a variation on planking in which a person squats “like an owl” in a populated and uncommon area.
"Before the Lord’s against India in 2011), Anderson, along with Stuart Broad and Steve Finn, resorted to Owling to relieve tension."
"In Central Park's North Woods and around its Loch, Barry finds an abundance of the prey it likes, doing most of its owlin' out after dusk."
"All of these owling activities qualify as a real hoot for birders on this island of brick and glass and steel, coronating Barry -- who appears mostly indifferent -- the city's latest celebrity bird."
"For those who might embark on an owling adventure this season, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Audubon Great Lakes are reminding people that there are certain precautions to take when it comes to safe, ethical viewing of these enchanting birds."
Another reason why winter is a good time for owling: It’s breeding season for some of Michigan’s native owl species.
"The bottom line, according to the DNR, is to enjoy the magic of Michigan winter owling, but to do so respectfully."
Triposo uses a sophisticated algorithm to find you the best places to visit wherever you are going.
"From unique historical adventures, to hidden gems of the food world, Triposo allows you to ditch your guidebook and plan a unique trip catered to you."
"Back in September, Jon Tirsen and Douwe Osinga, two ex-Googlers, unveiled their new mobile travel guide, Triposo, setting out to do for travel content what Google and PageRank did for search."
"Of course, this is no easy task, and Triposo has been in an ongoing process of honing these content algorithms, launching 30 destination travel guides for iOS and Android to help test the waters and encourage user feedback."
"Today, Triposo is ready to take its next big step forward, officially unveiling its new and improved iOS app, which aims to make the old hands of travel content, like Lonely Planet, shake in their boots."
"The main attraction of its new app, says COO Richard Osinga, is that Triposo is now a “self-starter” — in other words, a travel guide that actively offers suggestions as to where users should go next."
"But what is perhaps the coolest feature of the new Triposo app is that they now register the direction one is looking in, so that as a user roams the streets of a new city, the app highlights the top destinations in front of them."
"That’s the key to Triposo: It’s free, it works offline so you won’t incur roaming fees, offers travel guides for dozens of countries, more than 8,000 points of interest, and 250K places, has a travel dashboard, weather updates, currency converter, and foreign language phrasebooks."
"In the eight months since launch, Triposo has seen over 1 million iOS downloads and over 700K Android downloads."
"The startup’s early traction has continued to make it appealing to investors, as Triposo recently added a second, small-ish tranche of seed funding from new investor CrunchFund, as well as contributions from its existing investors, which include Chris Sacca, Taher Haveliwala, Google Wave Co-founder and Google Maps Lead Engineer Lars Rasmussen, and InterWest Partners."
"For more, check out Triposo at home here."
"To create Landed, Triposo used clever algorithms to match airports to cities."
Triposo is the Amsterdam and Berlin based startup behind Landed and is known for its popular travel guides apps with over 10 million downloads to date.

"To do this, it has acquired Amsterdam-based Triposo, a startup that says it has found an automated way to curate travel recommendations for relevant things to see and do."
"For example, Triposo’s technology might recommend a visit to a children’s museum to parents traveling with their kids in a small town in Austria."
The integration means Musement will mix Triposo’s travel recommendations for relevant things to see and do with its bookable activities.
"The overlapping content will appear on Triposo’s and Musement’s websites and mobile apps and via application programming interfaces, which connect to distribution partners, like airlines and online travel agencies."
"The acquisition is a $7 million stock swap where the investors, including InterWest Partners, Chris Sacca, Lars Rasmussen, Crunch Fund, and others, received Musement shares in return for Triposo stock."
"Founded in 2011, Triposo was founded by ex-Googlers founded looking to create mobile travel guides using an algorithmic approach."
"Nishank Gopal took over as Triposo CEO, and the company shifted to focusing on building a business-to-business product, namely, a sophisticated machine-learning and algorithmic platform for content."
Triposo’s tool parses terabytes of textual travel content online to enable partners to grasp the core characteristics of a destination or a point of interest.
"Among the many, many apps I use all the time are WhatsApp, Adobe Lightroom CC, Couchsurfing, Triposo, Culture Trip, and Google Photos."
"Let the free Triposo (Android, iOS) app be your guide."
The company also bought trip planning startup Triposo last year.
"Last year, the airport welcomed 6.2 million passengers in 2018, as opposed to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport’s 46.5 million, according to Triposo."
"We've teamed up with Triposo, a travel app that lists locations around the world based on the number of positive mentions across social review sites."
Triposo conducted a survey to learn more about bad tourist behavior abroad.
"That's according to an online, unscientific survey by travel app Triposo, which asked more than 700 travelers about their travel behavior, polling them on everything from travel pet peeves to the adventures they stumble upon while abroad."
"""For a lot of people, travel is a great excuse to let loose and get adventurous,"" said Richard Osinga, chief operating officer and founder of Triposo."
"Travelers with a spontaneous streak will love Triposo, an app that gives you personalized suggestions for things to do on your trip while you're on the go."
"Before you go on your trip, download Triposo's destination guide to your device, and while you're there, get real-time updates about what's going on nearby."
"Created by Berlin-based travel app maker Triposo, it’s a belt with embedded buzzers."
"Plug it into your smartphone via the audio jack, and the Triposo app can guide you around a city by buzzing your midsection to indicate whether you should go left, right, forward, or backward."
"Tragically, when Triposo tried to fund it by crowdfunding the idea on Indiegogo, it raised less than a third of its goal, leaving the Travel Belt dream in limbo for now."
"As with many travel guide apps, the content and maps are available offline so you don't bother with roaming bills.Triposo is using content from Wikipedia, Wikitravel, World66 and other open content travel guides to compile up-to-date, rich travel guides for cities around the world."
Turkey Travel Guide by Triposo is a free app that delivers complete city guides to your smartphone's screen.
Triposo also offers a phrasebook with useful Turkish phrases.
"If Istanbul is not the only stop of your travel in Turkey or if you just need a free app with offline support, you can download the Turkey Travel Guide by Triposo from the App Store or Google Play Store.Ulmon Guides has the one goal to make your journey easy and fun."
"We’ve teamed up with Triposo, a travel app that lists locations around the world based on the number of positive mentions across social review sites."
A 2013 survey by the Triposo travel site showed that 42 percent of Russians consider their own countrymen to be “the most ill-behaved” while traversing home soil.
India Travel Guide by Triposo is the best customized mobile application has efficiently substituted heavy guidebooks in the bags of frequent travelers.
The best part of the Triposo travel app is it is available individually for multiple countries and also in one complete travel package app know as World Travel Guide by Triposo.
"Billed as the travel guide for the whole world, Triposo (free) creates guides out of content from open sources like Wikitravel and World66."
"The airport welcomed 6.2 million passengers in 2018, as opposed to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's 46.5 million, according to Triposo."
"Kandler says that last year’s 6 million downloads were around four times those of the more high-profile Lonely Planet, and nearly nine times that of Triposo, a venture-backed travel app startup founded by ex-Googlers."

"Unlike most travel platforms, Musement's content and booking options span multiple verticals, from guided tours and museums to food and wine tastings, across numerous touch-points such as the B2C Musement and Triposo websites and apps, and the joint B2B APIs."
"There are quite a few startups attacking the tour guide app space which, as well as packaging the traditional (paper) guidebook into a handy app form, are more generally trying to bridge the connectivity gap that tourists face when they take their phone abroad and don’t want to be burnt by roaming costs (e.g. Triposo or PocketGuide)."
"Here at Triposo, we’re no strangers to adventure."
"Another, Triposo, was acquired last year by Musement for an undisclosed sum."
"Granted, there are some cool startups, like Triposo and Gogobot out there, but sites and apps like the former are taking an algorithmic approach to travel recommendations — no real people in sight."
"Unlike most travel platforms, Musement offers content and booking options across multiple verticals, from guided tours and museums, to food & wine - and multiple touch-points; the B2C Musement and Triposo websites and apps, and the joint B2B APIs."
"Travel agents are then able to take advantage of this and sell high value and high engagement products via voice,” says Nishank Gopalakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer, Triposo."
"He argues that What Now?!’s daily itinerary map-centric approach makes the experience significantly different to rivals such as Triposo, which also makes interactive offline travel guides but are again following a more well-worn guidebook-style format."
The travel technology company Triposo is crowdfunding a new navigation gadget that may shock you—literally.
"I used one called Triposo, which was not bad."
I thoroughly enjoyed the Triposo travel guide app.

"However, the French are not the world’s worst tourists: a recent Triposo survey named Americans No1 for boorish, rude behaviour, followed by British, Russians, the Chinese and Australians."
"In Istanbul with Adam Hills, they go to the historic Hagia Sophia just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the Triposo app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips."

ORIX Credit Corporation and Innovative Financial Risk Specialist AdviceRobo have announced that they have started to work together to explore the potential of innovative alternative credit scoring in ORIX card loan services.
ORIX Credit plans to incorporate AdviceRobo's psychographic credit scoring solution into its loan application process in Japan.
"Leveraging its financial services industry expertise and AI capabilities, AdviceRobo has built several innovative credit scoring methodologies."
AdviceRobo credit scoring helps with a broad-based credit scoring mechanism beyond the traditional parameters employed by agencies and credit bureaus.
"AdviceRobo uses other tangible factors like, in the cooperation with ORIX, a psychometric profile to determine the creditworthiness of a new customer."
AdviceRobo was founded in the Netherlands in 2015 and initially launched a psychographic credit scoring solution in the UK.
"Through collaboration with ORIX Credit, AdviceRobo explores the new possibilities of Japan's credit screening system."
"""We expect the experimental use of AdviceRobo's credit scoring for our loan card products to help perfect our credit knowhow and that the solution will offer the potential to expand our loans to many customers."", comments Yoshinori Kimura, director at ORIX Credit Corporation."
"As one of the most innovative global financial risk specialists, the potential offered by working with AdviceRobo looks perfect for me: In the digital era where consumers expect seamless access to loans and other financial services, this perfect combination will support the strong growth of ORIX Credit"", said AdviceRobo CEO Diederick van Thiel."
"Accounting and consulting firm KPMG has taken a minority stake in AdviceRobo, a FinTech startup which its acquirer last year lauded as one of the globe’s 50 most promising FinTechs."
"AdviceRobo, which is based in the Netherlands, provides a technology which helps banks and retail lenders with better predicting financial risk of people and companies taking out loans."
"Rob Fijneman, Head of Advisory at KPMG in the Netherlands, describes AdviceRobo as a “frontrunner in the sector”, highlighting that the firm will bolster KPMG’s AI-based predictive behavioral services for lenders."
AdviceRobo’s software applies AI on non-financial data including the behavior of potential borrowers.
"In addition, AdviceRobo’s algorithms can help with the identification of vulnerable consumers (those at risk of defaulting on loans in the future, churn and bad debt), providing lenders with more insight on risk-reward returns."
"The Big Four has taken a minority interest in the FinTech startup, in a move that comes three quarters after KPMG in fact named AdviceRobo one of the globe’s most promising FinTechs."
"KPMG’s list, created in collaboration with an investment firm, consists of two rankings: one list that identifies the globe’s 50 most renowned FinTech companies, and another which included AdviceRobo that zooms in on potential future disrupters."
AdviceRobo CEO Diederick van Thiel said that the cooperation with “such a prominent player as KPMG” will accelerate the firm’s global growth trajectory.
"On top of the financial injection, AdviceRobo will be granted access to KPMG’S expertise in the fields of risk management, regulation and data and analytics, as well as its global network to support the firm’s expansion drive."
"AdviceRobo currently serves its clients in ten countries across Europe and Latin America through offices in Amsterdam, London and Paris."
"Among AdviceRobo’s client roster are Argenta and Visii in the Netherlands, OTP Group in Hungary, and Banco Macro in Argentina."
"The partnership between KPMG and AdviceRobo is led by Erik Rood, a partner in KPMG’s Dutch Financial Services practice."
Co-founder Van Thiel and Steenkamer will continue to head AdviceRobo.
"AdviceRobo has launched an open banking capability for lenders (Business Insider), Rated: A AdviceRobo focuses on offering credit risk management solutions, and its latest API product enables lenders to categorize transactional data and predict defaults to make sound credit decisions."
"AdviceRobo empowers millennials and SMEs that are not served by traditional banks, by predicting creditworthiness, default, prepayments, churn and risk."
AdviceRobo solutions make use of a machine learning platform that combines data from structured and unstructured sources to score and predict risk behavior of consumers.
"Inspired by the pandemic, a new program offered by an offshoot of food-and-beverage incubator Hatch is looking to help local restaurants land their wares on store shelves."
Hatch’s Consumer Product Goods Bootcamp program is a 12-week crash-course in the skills restaurateurs need to create a packaged food product inspired by their menus.
"“Making something in the restaurant for service is different from scaling something up for the shelf,” Hatch President and co-founder Austin Green said."
"It’s the first major program to come out of Hatch Helps, a budding nonprofit community outreach program under the Hatch banner, which also includes the commissary kitchen concept Hatch Kitchen in Clopton Siteworks on the Southside and the Hatch Local food hall that will open this summer in Manchester."
"The program is free to participants, with Hatch Helps picking up the tab."
"Karina Benavides, who co-owns Abuelita’s with husband Everardo Fonseca, said she had thought about getting into packaged goods prior to joining Hatch’s program but felt unsure how to navigate the process."
Hatch is still working through exactly where the restaurants’ products will be sold.
"While Hatch Kitchen facilities are used to manufacture the products during the program, the participants are able to relocate their production if they choose once they’ve completed the courses."
"Hatch publicly announced the program May 24, but it has been ongoing since the spring."
"The Hatch mentorship network carries out the instruction, which has largely been one-on-one due to the pandemic."
Hatch Helps launched in early 2020 as a community feeding program.
"The organization pays for ingredients, and Hatch members donate time to make food that’s distributed by the program."
"Three BILCO Roof Hatch Models Approved For Hurricanes, Wind"
The BILCO Company now offers additional standard-sized roof hatches that are approved for hurricane and wind resistance by the Miami-Dade County Building Code Compliance Office and Florida Building Commission.
"Roof hatches provide safe and convenient access to roof areas by means of an interior ladder, ship stair, or service stair."
"BILCO has added the 36”x36” (Type E), 48”X48” (Type F), and 30”x96” (Type L) standard size-size roof hatches to its line of specialty access products approved to withstand severe weather conditions, joining the company’s S and NB sizes which were previously offered."
"The hatches are specifically designed and tested to withstand hurricanes and severe weather systems, and the new sizes offer more options for architects who are specifying roof hatches for projects located in hurricane zones."
BILCO collaborated with the Miami-Dade County Building Code Compliance Office and Florida Building Commission to determine which Testing Application Standards would be required for roof hatches.
"To test the ability to endure high hurricane winds, the Uniform Static Air Pressure Test, per TAS 202, was first employed on the roof hatches."
The hatches were placed in a test chamber and a 70 pound per square foot (PSF) uplift force was applied to the underside of the covers.
"Additionally, pressurized water, simulating wind-driven rain, was sprayed directly on the hatches for 15 minutes to assess their water-tightness in these demanding conditions."
"At the end of these tests, BILCO hatches maintained their integrity as the covers remained closed and the full-perimeter gasketing ensured complete weather-tightness."
BILCO hatches were also tested for the impact of wind-borne debris.
The test measured the damage and integrity of the roof hatch after impact.
The heavy-gauge construction of BILCO hatches withstood the impact and the heavy-duty slam latches ensured that the covers remained closed.
"This test, TAS 203, subjected the roof hatches to a 140 PSF force that alternated between uplift and downdraft and was applied for 671 cycles."
The test measured the amount of deflection in the roof hatch covers and again examined the products’ integrity after testing.
"Hatch (elbow) resumed his rehab assignment at Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday, pitching two scoreless innings while allowing no hits and one walk in a 29-pitch start."
"After opening the season on the 60-day injured list with an inflamed right elbow, Hatch began his rehab assignment at Buffalo on May 20 with a three-inning start."
"According to Arden Zwelling of Sportsnet.ca, Hatch was omitted from Buffalo's pitching schedule for the next three weeks due to ""mild tightness in his side,"" but he's apparently overcome that issue."
2022 Honda Civic Hatchback Teased Before June 23 Unveiling
"Valerie grew up in Richmond, where she raised her four children with her eternal companion Larry Hatch."
Honda's redesigned 2022 Civic compact sedan unveiled in April will soon be joined by its hatchback sibling.
Honda late on Wednesday released a teaser photo of the redesigned 2022 Civic Hatchback and confirmed the reveal for June 23.
"As the teaser and our earlier spy shots confirm, the hatch has more of fastback profile than the traditional upright design."
2022 Honda Civic Hatchback spy shots - Photo credit: S.
Honda hasn't said what powertrains will feature in the hatch but the sedan is currently being offered with a base 2.0-liter inline-4 rated at 158 hp and 138 lb-ft of torque and a spicier 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 rated at 180 hp and 177 lb-ft.
"The sedan is also being offered exclusively with a continuously variable transmission for now, though the hatch will add a 6-speed manual to the mix."
We're glad to see Honda hasn't forgotten its hot hatch roots.
"Speaking of hot hatches, expect sporty Si and Type R versions of the hatch at some point."
"While production of the sedan is being handled at a plant in Alliston, Canada, the hatch will be sourced from a plant in Greensburg, Indiana."
It will be the first time a Civic Hatchback has been sourced from a U.S. plant.
Arguably it was not the advent of modern electric cars that undermined the allure of cars such as the M3 so much as the onset of some truly phenomenal hot hatches many years ago.
"More than that, it’s a car that can rightly claim the hot hatch crown from the VW Golf GTi."
"Simply tasked with building a car that could win the hot hatch race, they proved their worth."
"If you want that sweet mix of performance and refinement delivered by the hot hatch brigade, then the 128ti has all you need."
Our verdict: BMW steals the hot-hatch crown.
"When then-President Bill Clinton signed The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) the week before Thanksgiving in 1993, it marked a remarkable bipartisan effort between Utah Republican Orrin Hatch and Massachusetts Democrat Ted Kennedy."
"Religious freedom was sewn into the very fabric of this country from the beginning, and protecting the right of conscience for every American is essential to the future of our republic,” Hatch said in a press release from Becket."
"Hatch was named the recipient more than a year ago, but the award presentation, typically presented at a gala dinner in New York City, was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic which shut down the country."
Hatch’s work highlighted the annual event.
"“Specifically, we are both committed to religious freedom for all people,” he said, listing some of the reasons Hatch is deserving of the Canterbury honor."
"“Orrin Hatch is a model of integrity, his public service always focused on what he considered best for the country not his personal agenda or personal ambitions,” he said."
"He noted the unique gathering of people of faith, “called to be witnesses of hope,” and praised Hatch’s legacy of defending the Constitution."
"Mark Rienzi, president of Becket, highlighted Hatch’s legislative accomplishments solidifying religious protections."
"Hatch’s commitment to religious liberty, our freedom of conscience would simply not be what it is today,” he said in the release."
"Wednesday, the Hatch Foundation in conjunction with Becket, held a religious liberty seminar highlighting some of the legal action by Becket in defense of religious liberty."
"Matt Sandgren, Hatch Foundation executive director, summarized Hatch’s significant contributions in a single tweet:"
“Senator Hatch’s defense of religious liberty was animated by the belief that an attack on one religion is an attack on all — and it’s that very same belief that brings us together today.”
Such requirements are not unusual but it could give the government an escape hatch – if it wants one.
"Audi has published the first official preview images of its upcoming RS3 hot hatchback and saloon, suggesting a reveal is imminent."
"Shown in camouflage as part of the wider Audi Sport line-up, the RS3 hatchback and RS3 Sportback are shown in production-ready guise, wearing a promotional wrap emblazoned with the sequence 1-2-4-5-3, likely a reference to the firing order of its five-cylinder powerplant."
A Masked Lapwing extends one of its long legs as it hatches out in the hands of the new study's lead author.
But hatchlings of ground-nesting birds can neither flee nor defend themselves; their response in the face of danger is to hunker down and mute their cries.
It turns out that this innate behavior does not just begin on hatching.
Embryos of these birds typically emit embryonic calls—vocalizations from within the egg that occur in the last few days of incubation prior to hatching.
"To conduct the study, researchers spent many hours searching wetlands, saltmarshes, and fields for nests and waited until the eggs were within two to four days of hatching."
"The first of those questions is why embryos call at all while still in the egg, when surely it would be safer to remain silent until they hatch."
"More recently, a Spanish team studying Yellow-legged Gulls found that exposure to parental alarm calls during incubation affected chick growth and behavior on hatching, indicating that the acoustic environment can have profound effects on embryo development."
"Kleindorfer says it is possible that they call to synchronize hatch date, which is particularly important in ground-nesting species since they are well-developed on hatching and leave the nest to forage independently very soon after."
The new car’s faster steering and slightly firmer suspension also contribute to an involving hatch that represents one of the best driver’s cars in its class.
"Refined, engaging, and loaded with tech, the Volkswagen remains a class benchmark, but a soaring price and the waning relevance of hatchbacks will hamper sales."
"That's changed in the model's latest generation, where this hot hatch has finally come into its own."
"If you've never noticed, VW's performance hatchbacks are color-coded, with the GTI leaning heavily on red and the Golf R relying on blue."
"The EPA has yet to release estimates for this new model, but for context, the previous one managed 23 mpg city and 30 mpg highway, which isn't bad for a powerful AWD hot hatch."
"But then again, a Honda Civic Type R is nearly $39,000 these days, and the VW does feel more premium, so perhaps that's just what state-of-the-art hot hatchery costs nowadays."
"For a guy raised on inexpensive hot hatches, that's still a tough pill to swallow, even though this new model won't be confused with a 1.8-liter Golf anymore."
"Hatch (elbow) is scheduled to make his second rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo on Wednesday, Mike Harrington of The Buffalo News reports."
Hatch will presumably get the green light to work deeper into Wednesday's outing after he was capped at three innings and 43 pitches in his 2021 debut May 20 versus Worcester.
Hatch will likely need one additional rehab start after Wednesday before Toronto decides whether he's fit to return from the 60-day injured list.
"“The solar panel array does two things, it collects solar in the summertime but it also has a bifacial system that collects off of the surface and patio space in the wintertime,” Jeff Hatch with Hatch Design and Architecture previously told the planning and zoning commission."
"“It was our understanding that the concern had to do more about the safety and efficiency of solar panel products that they were familiar with, and less about the concern for height,” Hatch said.And working with planning staff there is an exception for that height in regards to antennas and other such ancillary structures to a building.”"
"“It was prudent to provide a minimum of two parking spaces for the development per apartment, the four apartments,” Hatch said."

"CHICAGO (WLS) -- Mother's Day is Sunday and one Chicago florist is busy filling three thousand orders, and every bouquet benefits a local charity.To say thank you for all their hard work and their commitment to giving back, ABC's Strahand and Sara surprised the owners of Flowers For Dreams with lunch from their favorite restaurant Nini's Deli.Steven Dyme and Jo Dickstein started their business when they were 19 years' old, selling flowers at graduation ceremonies.""For every bouquet we sell to a parents we would donate a backpack complete with school supplies to a student in need,"" Dyme said.They continue that tradition by donating twenty five percent of their profits to local charities.""Now today we have donated nearly 500 thousand dollars just around half a million dollars to over 50 charities around the Chicagoland and Milwaukee area just on the sale of flowers,"" Dickstein said.You can watch the entire lunch surprise here Strahan and Sara airs weekdays at 12 p.m. on ABC7."
"The business posted the question on Sunday night, said co-founder and CEO Steven Dyme."
"The hope is that the message will reinforce Flowers for Dreams' values of being inclusive and supporting people while rejecting ideals like Nazism or racial superiority, Dyme said."
"It isn't controversial to reject Nazism or white supremacy, Dyme said, but some people feel like their more progressive views are ""under attack."""

"Reynen Court, a company that aims to help law firms and in-house legal departments test and adopt cloud-based software applications, is growing its team soon after launching a new full-service offering."
Reynen Court on Thursday said the company has brought on Sarah Glassmeyer as its legal tech curator.
"Glassmeyer joins Reynen Court from the American Bar Association, where she was counsel and a project specialist manager in its innovation center."
"""Sarah is a true legal innovator with a wealth of hands-on experience driving change across the legal landscape and a passion for reimagining how we describe, learn about, and organize legal technologies,"" Christian Lang, Reynen Court's chief strategy officer, said in a statement."
"The company said in the announcement that she will play a ""lynchpin role in generating the content and strategy for the Solution Store, a central pillar of the Reynen Court platform."""
"Reynen Court's platform allows companies and firms to find, test, purchase and manage third-party software applications."
"Reynen Court is one of several legal tech and legal services companies that have raised fresh funding from investors, law firms and others in the past year."
Reynen Court in February also added Jae Um to its advisory board.
"The Thursday hire comes on the heels of Reynen Court's April 23 launch of a new full-service offering, which gives firms and legal departments ""turn-key access"" to a full solution without needing to manage their own private cloud, platform and technology deployment, the company said at the time."
"Reynen Court said two other ""sizable law firms"" are slated to roll out the full-service offering during the second quarter of the year."
"""Like everyone in our industry, we see no end to the onslaught of new technologies,"" Koch said, ""and Reynen Court will allow us to cut through the noise so that we may rapidly adopt technologies that improve our efficiency and facilitate purposeful interactions with our clients."""
Reynen Court introduces secure cloud offering for law firms
"Reynen Court Inc., a fast-growing software company supported by a consortium of twenty of the largest global law firms, is launching a new full-service offering designed to accelerate innovation and expand adoption of its legal technology platform by law firms and in-house legal departments."
"The Reynen Court platform helps firms and law departments efficiently source, test and buy, safely deploy, and strategically manage best-in-class software applications."
"“Before we even launched to the very large law firms that helped us design the platform, innovation teams at several large and mid-sized firms started asking us whether we could provide these elements on a full-service basis,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew D. Klein."
"In connection with the launch, Reynen Court and Womble Bond Dickinson, a firm of 1,100 lawyers in 26 offices across the U.S. and the U.K., jointly announced that the firm had signed up for the new model in order to speed up their sourcing, testing and acquiring of new cloud-based technologies."
"Bridgewater saw former senior counsel Gary Beeson and deputy general counsel Sylvia Khatcherian, a board member at legal technology company Reynen Court LLC, leave its ranks last September."
"In its version 2.0, Reynen Court is rolling out improvements to ensure the platform can consistently meet “the very high standards for security and resiliency required by large law firms,” according to a Thursday statement from the Amsterdam-based company."
"Reynen Court, backed by a consortium of 19 leading U.S. and U.K.-based law firms, enables firms and corporate legal departments to streamline traditional tech procurement by providing an online store along with tools to test applications for functionality within the rest of their digital infrastructures."
Reynen Court has attracted industry attention due to early and public buy-in and financial investment from prominent Big Law players.
"With this 2.0 release, “we are rounding first base with a full head of steam,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein in the statement."
"Reynen Court confirmed in April that it had taken steps to cut costs, including 20% salary cuts for its senior executive team as well as freezes on new hiring and non-essential spending."
Legaltech company Reynen Court has launched a new version of its app store platform that allows law firms and in-house teams to more easily access and manage third-party software applications without stressing their own IT infrastructure.
"Reynen Court’s new full-service platform adds to its existing self-managed platform, where users provide their own infrastructure to host the platform and manage all third-party applications in-house."
"Venky Srinivasan, chief evangelist at Reynen Court and former chief technology officer at Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot, said: “For law firms and law departments that seek to access a portfolio of modern cloud-based solutions without having to trust their confidential data to a large and growing number of disparate [software-as-a-service] vendors, our full-service model will give them a powerful alternative to the self-managed platform.”"
"Bill Koch, chief knowledge officer at Womble Bond Dickinson in the US, said: “Like everyone in our industry, we see no end to the onslaught of new technologies, and Reynen Court will allow us to cut through the noise so that we may rapidly adopt technologies that improve our efficiency and facilitate purposeful interactions with our clients.”"
"Last October, Reynen Court secured $4.5m in further funding to accelerate its growth, adding to the $3m it raised in January 2020."
Reynen Court backer Orrick earlier this month spun-out its first standalone business from its legaltech innovation hub Orrick Labs.
"DocsCorp, a leading provider of enterprise productivity solutions, announced today its participation in the Reynen Court Solutions Store."
"By listing in Reynen Court’s Solutions Store, compareDocs has the potential to benefit law firms on a global scale."
Reynen Court brings together the world’s largest law firms and over 100 of the most significant vendors to create a true marketplace for legal technology through its Solution Store.
"“Reynen Court is solving a significant problem in legal tech today, which is the time and effort it takes for law firms to source, test, and deploy new and innovative technologies."
"Andrew Klein, Founder and CEO of Reynen Court, noted, “We are very pleased to add DocsCorp to our platform."
"Japan’s largest law firm, Nishimura & Asahi, has become the latest firm to pour money into legal technology platform Reynen Court, the company said Monday."
"MAIDENHEAD, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SDL (LSE: SDL), the intelligent language and content company, is pleased to announce its machine translation (MT) technology is now available through the Reynen Court LLC platform, enabling legal firms and departments to easily provision and deploy SDL Machine Translation to securely translate any type of legal document or file."
"The Reynen Court platform combines a content-rich solution store and a powerful control panel that simplifies the process for law firms and legal departments to source, evaluate, deploy, monitor and manage legal technology applications."
"“We regularly hear from our customers that machine translation is among their top investment priorities,” said Andy Klein, CEO of Reynen Court."
That is why we are so excited to welcome SDL into the Reynen Court ecosystem.
"Reynen Court was established with support from a consortium of 19 leading global law firms, 13 of which currently work with SDL, and it only offers technology through its platform that meets robust security requirements."
SDL’s secure machine translation technology conforms to Reynen Court’s stringent security protocols.
"“We’re delighted that SDL Machine Translation is the first language technology to feature on the Reynen Court platform,” said Christophe Djaouani, EVP, SDL."
Reynen Court LLC (www.reynencourt.com) enables law firms and corporate legal departments to speed their adoption of AI and other new technologies.
"Founded by serial Internet entrepreneur and former Cravath, Swaine and Moore associate Andrew D. Klein, Reynen Court is supported by a broad consortium of nineteen of the largest global law firms."
Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins serve as co-chairs of the Reynen Court consortium.
The legal tech “app store” Reynen Court has secured $3 million more in funding as the startup prepares for its official launch in the first quarter of this year.
"The funding includes new financing from Ventech, an early-stage venture capital fund, and from Prins H LLC, an investment vehicle controlled by Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein."
"Reynen Court will allow attorneys at law firms and corporate legal departments the ability to browse scores of legal tech tools, including many powered by artificial intelligence."
The funding comes as the Reynen Court platform enters its fifth month of live beta mode testing.
They include Reynen Court co-chair firms Latham & Watkins and Clifford Chance; vice chair Paul Weiss; White & Case; and Orrick.
Reynen Court was designed in significant part to accelerate the legal industry’s adoption of AI and other new technologies.
"Reynen Court received a boost last month when a unit of Big Four accountancy Deloitte, Deloitte Legal Ventures, included Reynen among a small group of startups they’ll be be working with to test and scale their platform."
"Nishimura & Asahi, Japan’s largest law firm, has invested in Reynen Court, a curated “app store” allowing access to numerous legal-tech software applications via a secure platform."
"Reynen Court’s platform allows Nishimura to run cloud-based applications in private clouds under the firm’s control, enabling testing and adoption of the latest legal technologies while maintaining security and stability, and also localising global legal-tech products for the Japan and Asia markets."
"Officially launched in 2018, Reynen Court announced in October that it had secured $4.5 million in funding from investors as Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins."
"The legal tech “app store” Reynen Court has announced its official launch, as the platform continues to gain new backing from Big Law firms."
"Since Reynen Court’s 2018 founding, the group has enlisted 19 prominent firms to join its consortium, and has gained a total of more than $10 million in investments."
"Since the ILTA Conference a few weeks ago, I’ve been hearing and reading about Reynen Court."
"What’s unique about Reynen Court, however, is the automation and interoperability the platform offers."
"Reynen Court recently launched a beta version of its platform, which is intended to help legal operations teams in corporate and at law firms gain fast access to software applications without worrying about the time, cost, and hassle of on-premise implementation, expensive infrastructure, or concerns about cloud security."
"What’s makes Reynen Court useful is it enables subscribers to find and buy software, manage computing power and user access, and it provides metrics that aid in monitoring usage and expenditures."
"Currently, there are more than 50 applications available in the Reynen Court platform, and they are continuously adding more."
Does this mean that legal departments and law firms will soon be able to subscribe to popular solutions like Relativity via Reynen Court?
"CEO Andy Klein, a former Cravath attorney turned brewery owner and asset manager who founded Reynen Court in 2017 on the premise that he wanted to accelerate adoption of legal technology, believes there is plenty of room in the legal tech space for large SaaS providers; Reynen Court will be available for those organizations who cannot or choose not to make that investment."
"With Reynen Court, software offerings in the platform can be deployed almost instantly, even on a Friday at 5 p.m. when a transactional team realizes they need to dig into some documents as part of a due diligence effort."
Lang says that Reynen Court is working to develop a tiered pricing model that scales based on usage.
"Another source of revenue comes from the software companies that make their products available for deployment through the platform, which pay a fee to Reynen Court."
"Additionally, if a software company chooses to sell their product through the Reynen platform, there’s a revenue share with Reynen Court."
"In fact, there’s an advantage to using Reynen Court for medium to small organizations and firms — those who do not have the infrastructure or resources to run a full suite of technology tools."
"For smaller companies with small legal departments or smaller firms that have big clients, Reynen Court could really level the playing field and give them access to the same tools as the largest firms."
Reynen Court is hoping to have a full commercial release in the first quarter of 2020.
"Reynen Court has announced an investment from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, its third from a prominent law firm as the legal technology “app store” nears a commercial launch."
"While the exact amount of Orrick’s investment hasn’t been released, it is less than the $2.1 million that Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins, co-chairs of 19-firm consortium, each made in December of 2018, Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein told Bloomberg Law."
"“The Reynen Court platform simplifies these steps, accelerating our clients’ ability to leverage new technology—which is a win for all of us.”"
"The next step, he said, will be to launch a version of the app that’s available to firms and law departments that enter licensing agreements with Reynen Court."
Klein has said Reynen Court will earn revenue from the fixed-fee annual licensing agreements and from firms’ software purchases through the “app store” itself.
"At the same time, legal tech “app store” Reynen Court, which has been backed by a consortium of 19 leading U.S. and U.K.-based law firms, has taken several steps to cut costs over recent weeks, said the startup’s founder and CEO, Andy Klein."
"Unlike Reynen Court, Elevate has not put a hiring freeze in place, Brown said."
"According to Klein, none of the 19 firms that are part of Reynen Court’s consortium have backed off their commitment to the company, which officially launched in late January after running a six-month beta test."
"All three of these marketplace debuts follow the formal launch last January of Reynen Court, the platform that has been dubbed the app store of law — and in which the aforementioned Orrick is a principal investor, along with global firms Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins — and come as Reynen on October 28 announced an additional $4.5 million in funding (and said just today that Japan’s largest firm has invested in the company)."
Reynen Court’s mission is to make it easier for law firms and legal departments to adopt and manage modern cloud-based software applications without having to trust firm or client content to the rapidly growing universe of vertically integrated SaaS providers.
"Notably, Reynen Court recently launched a new functionality called Test Drive, which founder and CEO Andrew Klein recently demonstrated for me."
"And, here, three is nowhere near a crowd (or four, factoring in Reynen Court)."
"Where Legaltech Hub and Orrick Observatory aim to be comprehensive catalogs, the TR Marketplace and Reynen Court focus on making it easier to test products in advance and then more seamlessly deploy them."
"(By the way, if you’d like to learn more, listen to my LawNext podcast episodes with Nicola Shaver, recorded just after ILTA named here Innovative Leader of the Year, and Reynen Court founder Andrew Klein.)"
"“The value law firms bring to the table beyond the money is their real understanding about the problem that you’re building your company to address,” said Andrew Klein, founder of the “app store for legal tech” Reynen Court, which has secured funding from Clifford Chance, Latham & Watkins and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe in recent years, including a $4.5 million investment round announced in late October."
"Bridgewater Associates’ deputy general counsel has signed on to the board of growing legal tech company Reynen Court, which will function as a legal tech app store and is already backed by a group of major law firms."
"Reynen Court is primed to help law firms and corporate legal departments take advantage of a fast-growing legal tech market, which topped $400 million in funding to legal tech vendors in the first quarter of 2019, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis."
The Reynen Court app will allow lawyers to purchase legal tech vendor programs and download them onto their phones and work laptops in secure “cloud” environments.
"“Sylvia will guide us as we build support for moving law firm and client content out of traditional on-premise data centers and into firm controlled but third-party hosted virtual private clouds,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew Klein in a statement."
"Reynen Court’s website lists 55 legal tech vendor programs that law firms using the platform will be able to choose from, including nine that tout the use of artificial intelligence."
"“By accelerating the adoption of legal technology, they have the potential to truly transform the legal industry for the benefit of law firms, their clients and society,” Khatcherian said of Reynen Court in the statement."
"Reynen Court’s five-member board also includes Tom Glocer, co-founder of BlueVoyant, a cyber security defense and APT monitoring company; Marcel Van Lohuizen, a longtime software engineer who has worked for Google since 2002; and Paul Greenwood and Ken Heaps, respectively the chief information officers for Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins."
"Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe’s investment arm participated in a funding round that raised $6.3 million for legal talent marketplace Priori Legal, while Latham & Watkins and Clifford Chance took part in a funding round for tech platform Reynen Court that secured $4.5 million."
"Unlike Reynen Court, Orrick noted it doesn’t sell any software on its platform."
And Reynen Court – which has created an app store for legaltech – also raised $4.5m of funding last October to accelerate its growth plans.
"Last year, Orrick launched an internal legal tech social network to help lawyers understand new digital tools, and in January, the firm invested in Reynen Court, a legal technology “app store” aimed at law firms and corporate legal departments."
"They include legal tech “app store” Reynen Court, which has enlisted 18 Big Law firms as backers, the law firm time-keeping startup Ping, and contract automation platform Avvoka."
"These include Reynen Court, which represents several of the world’s biggest law firms; LexFusion, which curates best of breed products for firms and legal departments; PartnerVine, a portal for buying and selling legal products; and several vendor app stores, whereby legal tech’s big providers give their customers quick access to partner products and services, and other tools and applications that add on to or integrate with their platforms."
"Meanwhile, the curated app platform with big-name backers, Reynen Court, has been given an extra $3m."
"Reynen Court, the platform aimed at simplifying the adoption of advanced legal technology has secured $3m of additional funding from an investment vehicle controlled by Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew D Klein, and Ventech, a global early-stage venture capital fund"
"Requiring masks unless all are vaccinated in a workplace would “create yet another barrier to rehiring and reopening” at a time when “we need to be providing incentives to bring people back,” they said."
Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology
"A latter-day concern with environmental stocktaking is at the heart of Kiel Moe’s latest book, Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology."
"Unless identifies and maps out this web, revealing to readers how a singular modernist building was not simply the result of singular design talents but rather physical, economic, and environmental processes spanning different times and multiple geographies."
"Be that as it may, Unless expands on previous Seagram literature, from Lambert’s searching and analytical Building Seagram (2013) and her sweeping edited volume Mies in America (2001) to the eclectic and interpretive The Presence of Mies (1994), edited by the late Detlef Mertins—an impressive body of work, to be sure, one signaling allegiances to art and architectural history with ease and panache."
"But with Unless, Moe aims for something more expansive."
"And yet the most enterprising readers may notice that he does not mention other contemporary scholars like Paul Edwards, Timothy Morton, or Jane Bennett, whose important work on the very issues of scale and ecology that drive Unless could comprise their own “novel theoretical framework.”"
"And yet, Unless is at its best when it is entirely and unapologetically conventional."
Unless certainly makes for a unique reading experience.
"Holding Unless, the synecdochic relationship between book and building becomes clear."
"Taking into account his desire to introduce architects to new, otherwise unfamiliar books and authors, some analytical and narrative drift is to be expected, and there is no doubt that Unless will resonate with architectural audiences wanting to know about the larger social, material, and analytical contexts for the Seagram Building."
"“Forcible separation” is a loaded term, and yet it captures something evident throughout the pages of Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology."
"Unless comes at us fully formed, but oddly devoid of any accounts of specific land use planning and economic maneuverings that also inform the Seagram Building’s construction ecology."

NNNCo has teamed up with Dutch manufacturer of wireless soil moisture sensors Sensoterra to bring its products to the Asia Pacific.
Sensoterra’s LoRaWAN soil moisture probes are available on the LoRAWAN AS923 band (923MHZ) enabling the devices to work on LoRaWAN networks across Australia and Asia Pacific.
An NNNCo spokesperson told IoTAustralia the company had funded stock of the probes jointly with Sensoterra for distribution in Australia.
"Sensoterra’s commercial director, Bas Van Der Velden, said NNNCo would provide local warehouseing for the company’s products."
"Now, Kerlink, a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), and Sensoterra, a specialist in wireless soil-moisture-sensor solutions, have announced a partnership to take care of water waste."
Sensoterra has been working with growers since its founding in 2014 to bring smart soil-moisture solutions to the market.
Sensoterra’s current line of probes can measure soil-moisture down to almost a meter deep and the associated software allows users to zoom into conditions around individual probes.
"“Less than 2% of agricultural land worldwide is equipped for soil-moisture measurement, which presents a very large market for wireless soil-monitoring and a big opportunity to improve water conservation,” said Christine Fraser-Boer, chief operating officer at Sensoterra."
"Using Kerlink’s LoRaWAN-based Low Power IoT Reference Design platform to produce a new class of soil-moisture sensors, Sensoterra will launch its new sensors in the U.S., Europe, and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region beginning this year."
"Accurate measurement of soil moisture is obviously key but, according to Jonathan Wisler (Sensoterra), developing world agriculture is still in the early stages of integrating soil moisture sensors into irrigation systems at scale."
"Sensoterra offers a soil moisture data platform that can be calibrated to soil type and integrated with other tools to combine data from weather forecasts, temperature and other readings, allowing growers to make ‘educated’ irrigation timing decisions."
"Wisler at Sensoterra believes growers will need fewer soil sensors in future and that it will be possible to estimate soil moisture “by using historical data about water penetration in your crop as well as soil type, combined with information from your irrigation controllers”."
"Semtech, Sensoterra and Senet highlighted precision agriculture solutions that require technologies that can withstand the elements, function reliably, operate for long periods of time without requiring changes in batteries, and deliver economic returns to commercial farmers, which has not been easy in the past."
"Scale is where Semtech, Sensoterra and Senet seem to be going."
"“Since announcing our partnership over a year ago, Sensoterra has proven the value of Semtech’s LoRa Technology and how low-cost, long-range LoRaWAN-based connectivity can deliver to the agriculture market,” said Bruce Chatterley, CEO at Senet."
“We look forward to building on these successes as both Sensoterra and Senet expand our solution deployments and connectivity offerings globally.”
"“As water becomes more scarce in many parts of the world, Sensoterra’s LoRa-based solutions allow farmers to manage their irrigation systems more efficiently,” said Jurriaan Ruys, CEO of Sensoterra."
"Sensoterra is a low-cost, wireless and remote system that offers farmers real-time insight into the soil moisture condition of their crops."
"Sensoterra primarily focuses on the North American and European agriculture markets and has deployed over 4,000 sensors and achieved 720,000 data points to date."
"Sensoterra’s solutions are now being deployed in Australia, South America and other parts of the world."
"Farmers can get real-time insight into the conditions of their crops soil with Sensoterra – an affordable, wireless, Internet of Things (IoT) method to monitor moisture levels remotely."
"Recently, Senet and Sensoterra BV announced a multiyear partnership in which Sensoterra’s soil-moisture system will operate on Senet’s standards-based Low Power Wide Area Network."
"Sensoterra’s sensors are rugged, self-sustaining, low cost, and wireless, which allows them to operate on a wireless network infrastructure in demanding conditions."
"Only these characteristics will allow growers to scale their deployments and benefit from true operational visibility,” says Jurriaan Ruys, CEO of Sensoterra."
"“Better radio technology for connectivity and the very low price for which we can offer the sensor are key drivers that have allowed sensor technology to reach agriculture,” says Bas van der Velden, sales director for Sensoterra."
"In May 2020, SensoTerra, for example, began new wireless systems to enhance agricultural networking and cloud field data analysis."
"In a commercial potato farm, farmers utilized Sensoterra’s LoRa-based soil irrigation sensor to reduce water usage by 30%."
