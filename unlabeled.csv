 0,"The global regulatory landscape is changing rapidly, making it a complicated scenario for medical device firms"
 0,The conventional 
 0,Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have the potential to transform health by extracting a massive amount of data during healthcare delivery
 0,"Recently, numerous pre-market approvals have been granted through the FDA's pre-market pathway"
 0,One such example is the algorithm used in the Apple Watch's AF detector and diabetes management support tools that provide personalized treatment plans
 0,"The FDA has signified a different strategy that shifts the center of mass for certification, particularly for AI-related technologies, aside from a complete focus on the device or its performance and toward the company and its processes."
 0,"Besides, increasing cybersecurity threats and the financial impact of data breaches are making manufacturers of medical devices implement strategies to ensure that their products remain secure"
 0,This is being accompanied by government support
 0,"For instance, in October 2018, the FDA collaborated with the U.S"
 0,"Department of Homeland Security to improve information sharing and collaboration to address cybersecurity risks, including less secure communication as well as prevention of unauthorized access when it comes to data transfer to and from the device."
 0,The regulatory writing and publishing segment dominated the market for medical device regulatory affairs with 36.4% of revenue share in 2020
 0,"This is largely attributed to the fact that these services are provided from the early stages of product development to premarket approval, as high-quality documentation is essential for regulatory affairs in order to escape delays in the approval process"

 0,"Hence, this creates more demand for the services supporting market growth."
 0,The outsourcing segment dominated the market for medical device regulatory affairs with the largest revenue share of 60.0% in 2020
 0,This is largely attributed to the lack of an in-house regulatory team
 0,"Besides, the advantages such as cost and time saving associated with the outsourcing of these services are contributing to the market growth."
 0,"Besides, new regulatory challenges, such as medical device regulation and in vitro diagnostic device regulation in Europe, as well as regulatory cybersecurity scrutiny, make market launch and recertification timelines difficult"
 0,It is incredibly challenging for businesses to manage regulatory hurdles with unskilled personnel which drives the demand of outsourcing these services.
 0,The therapeutics segment led the market for medical device regulatory affairs and accounted for the largest revenue share of more than 55.0% in 2020
 0,The segment is also projected to witness the fastest CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period
 0,"This may be attributed to the increasing prevalence of various chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory disorders that create demand for advanced therapeutic products."
 0,"For instance, increasing demand for technologically advanced products such as auto-injectors or pen needles for effective and efficient delivery of insulin in diabetic patients is driving the segment"
 0,"As there are multiple modalities involve in the combination product, more than one regulatory agency office reviews the submission"
 0,"Due to the complexity of combination products, it is difficult to understand which regulatory requirements apply to combination products"
 0,"Hence, this creates demand for these services."
 0,"Besides, with the increasing cases of COVID-19 around the world, there is a growing need for respiratory devices such as oxygen tanks, nebulizers, pulse oximeters, and spirometers, and ventilators for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, which is contributing to market growth"
