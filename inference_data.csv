 BUX, a zero-fee European retail brokerage, has strengthened its leadership with a couple of fresh hires: Mark Lamers RC as the new Chief Financial Officer and Erin Stewart as the Head of People and Culture. 
 Both of them are industry veterans as Lamers joined BUX from ABN Amro, where he was the Managing Director, while Stewart was previously Catawiki’s Vice President of People. 
The duo joined BUX months after the fintech raised $80 million and is aiming to expand further into Europe.
 “It is BUX’s mission to shape the future of how Europeans invest…This requires a team of industry experts and innovative thinkers who can build on the strong foundation of what we started in 2014,” said BUX CEO, Yorick Naeff. 
 “With these industry veterans onboard, and their wealth of experience and knowledge, we are bringing BUX to the next level to further shape the future of investing.” 
 “I’m thrilled to be entering the dynamic fintech space, and I am passionate about BUX’s mission to help empower a new generation of investors to take ownership of their financial future,” Lamers said. 
 On the other hand, Stewart is bringing two decades of experience to her new role at BUX. 
 Stewart commented: “As BUX enters this new phase of growth, it will be crucial to not only encapsulate the vibrant, start-up culture that has taken shape at the company but to bring it to an elevated level that will continue to attract Europe’s finest talent. 
Equally important will be to foster BUX’s existing in-house talent and expertise.”

 Different events were held across the two districts- Thatta and Sujawal to commemorate the third death anniversary of eminent Nationalist, political figure, writer, jurist, philosopher, and revolutionary leader Rasool Bux Palijo who rekindled progressive politics in Sindh. 
 Earlier Senator Sasuui Palijo, members of Awami Tehreek and fans of his political ideology laid floral wreaths and Ajraks on the grave of Rasool Bux Palijo. 
Paying tribute to Rasool Bux Palijo Senator Sasui Palijo who is also his niece said that Rasool Bux Palijo spearheaded several political struggles in Sindh and gave people of Sindh the courage to stand for their rights adding that he launched successful campaigns against conspiracies hatched by dictators against Sindh.
Poet Suraj Sujawali said that Rasool Bux Palijo and his father Sarvech Sujawali were close cronies who together took part in the MRD movement set into motion during the dictatorship.
 The Shaheed Allah Bux Soomro University of Art, Design and Heritage in Jamshoro recently advertised their vacant vice-chancellor position, but they only want male applicants. 
 In the latest development, Bux — a startup from Amsterdam that lets people invest in shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without paying commissions (its pricing is based on flat €1 fees for certain services, no fees for others) — has picked up some investment of its own, an $80 million round that it will be using to grow its business. 
 “Since we started, Bux has been trying to make investments affordable and intuitive, and that will still be the case,” he said. 
 The average age of a Bux customer is 30, so while affordable and intuitive are definitely priorities to capture younger users, it also means that if Bux can earn their loyalty and show positive returns, it has the potential to keep them for a long time to come. 
Naeff said in an interview that Bux isn’t disclosing its valuation with this round.
 But for some context, he confirmed that the startup has around 500,000 customers across the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium, using not just its main Bux Zero app, but also Bux Crypto and Bux X (a contracts for difference [CFDs] app). 
Crypto remains a niche but extremely active part of the wider investment market and Naeff described Bux Crypo — formed out of Bux acquiring Blockport last year — as “very profitable.”
 The bigger Bux had only raised about $35 million before this round, and it’s been around since 2014, so while he wouldn’t comment on wider profitability, you can draw some conclusions from that. 
 The opportunity that Bux is targeting is a very simple one: Technology, and specifically innovations in banking and apps, have opened the door to making it significantly easier for the average consumer to engage in a new set of financial services. 
 Although there is a wave of so-called neobrokers in the market today, Bux’s unique selling point, Naeff said, is the company’s tech stack. 
 In comparison to others providing trading apps, he said Bux is the first and only one of them to have built a full-stack system of its own. 
“We are excited about backing BUX as they are the leading neobroker in Europe and have been able to build a platform that is sustainable and scalable.
BUX is the only neobroker in Europe that offers zero commission investing without being dependent on kickbacks or payments for order flow.
 We will support BUX in its journey of pursuing consistent growth for the years to come”, said Alex Leung, assistant GM at Tencent, Strategic Development, in a statement. 
Other big European players that have also recently raised big expansion rounds include Amsterdam’s Bux ($80 million in April) and Vienna-based Bitpanda ($170 million in March).
 Interestingly, Tencent also led that last round for Bux, a part of its bigger investment efforts both in fintech and in the region. 
 The candidates of Progressive Lawyers Panel, for President Advocate of Supreme Court Manzoor Hussain Larik and General Secretary Miran Bux Shar are optimistic of winning the election and claim support of both the young and senior advocates. 
 Led by the award-winning Professor Faizal Bux, the Institute for Water and Wastewater Technology (IWWT), which plays a critical role in monitoring and tracking Covid-19 infection spread in Durban, believes the results of its SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance are a cause for concern. 
 It started from Shaheed Allah Bux Park and ended in front of the local press club, where participants held a sit-in and raised slogans against crackdown on fellow partymen. 
 Kotri police produced JSQM activists Abdul Khaliq Panhwar, Ali Bux Kaboro, Jibran Soomro and Mohammad Aslam Chandio in the court of a Kotri civil judge to seek their remand. 
 Bux offers a host of products, including Bux Zero , its commission-free share trading app; Bux Crypto ; and Bux X , which lets users trade contracts for difference (CFDs). 
 Bux is currently available in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France, and Belgium and plans to use the funding to expand to Ireland in the coming weeks and eventually to the UK. 
Bux established itself as one of the largest neobrokers in Europe after adding features to bolster user engagement and fund transfers amid the pandemic.
 Much like its peers , Bux experienced record growth in the past year, reaching 500,000 overall users, compared with 350,000 at the end of 2020, while Bux Zero tripled its assets under management, per AltFi. 
 Bux also launched new features in the past year to enhance its value proposition among its base users, whose average age is 30. 
 Led by Professor Faizal Bux and assisted by Professor Sheena Kumari, the team found a spike in viral loads in wastewater since March 30. 
 “This is indicating that eThekwini Municipality may already be experiencing the third wave of Covid-19 infections and that there was a greater number of infected individuals within the community than what is currently being reported,   Bux said in a statement last week. 
European-based BUX has recently announced that it has raised $80 milli on from a group of top-tier investors; backing its mission to become the region’s most prominent neo-broker.
 Existing investors HV Capital and Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures also participated in the round, showing their commitment to accelerate BUX’s strong, continued growth. 
 Having recently celebrated the arrival of their 500,000th customer, BUX will utilise this investment as an additional impetus to expand its investment app BUX Zero. 
 BUX Zero was created with the intention of making commission-free investing accessible, intuitive, and affordable for both first-time and existing investors; allowing them to invest in a large suite of shares or ETFs that they really care about. 
 To officially announce the launch of their new investment app in the most contemporary and accessible way possible, BUX headed to Clubhouse, the drop-in audio chat platform, unveiling the product on the 22nd of April. 
 BUX Zero has identified its target audience as Europe’s millennial population and hopes that the development of an app-based platform, alongside the state of commission-free investing, will draw a younger customer base to the platform. 
Nick will remain involved with BUX as a member of the non-executive board.
 “Younger generations in Europe now realise that investing is one of the few viable ways left to create a stable financial future,” added Yorick Naeff, BUX’s new CEO. 
 “With this new funding round, BUX will continue to spearhead innovation by implementing advanced features to further shape the future of how Europeans invest. 
 He added, “BUX has built the next generation of investing services that are low cost, convenient and intuitive for even the newest investor, while covering the full spectrum of investment options, including cryptocurrencies. 
“We are excited about backing BUX as they are the leading neo-broker in Europe and have been able to build a platform that is sustainable and scalable.
BUX is the only neo-broker in Europe that offers zero-commission investing without being dependent on kickbacks or payments for order flow.
 We will support BUX in its journey of pursuing consistent growth for the years to come”, said Alex Leung, Assistant GM at Tencent, Strategic Development. 
Royal Park Partners acted as an exclusive financial advisor to BUX and its shareholders throughout the transaction.
 In the past three months alone, BUX Zero has more than doubled its assets under management. 
 Having successfully launched BUX Zero in Germany, France, Austria, and Belgium in the past year, Europe’s fastest-growing neo-broker will continue its international expansion throughout 2021, solidifying its leadership position. 
 The institute, led by the award-winning Professor Faizal Bux and assisted by Professor Sheena Kumari, plays a critical role in monitoring and tracking Covid-19 infection spread in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. 
 Professor Bux said the team had used a scientific tool, Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE), which was based on the monitoring and constant analysis of viral particles shed in the stool of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, by examining wastewater from wastewater treatment plants. 
 This indicates that wastewater based epidemiology may be used as a predictive tool for surges in COVID-19 infections and that frequent monitoring is required for future wave predictions,” Bux said. 
 According to Bux, the technology should be expanded for application at sub-district level by testing sewage from sewer networks servicing suburbs. 
 In a recent development, Amsterdam-based fintech startup BUX Crypto has announced that it has seen explosive growth in the number of new user signups on its platform and also echoes the popularity of Bitcoin with a significant increase in the number of Bitcoins traded. 
The crypto platform of neo broker BUX saw a 500 per cent increase in average daily trades in January 2021 compared to December 2020.
 Bux, an Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based neo-broker, raised USD80m in follow-financing round.

 The full range of the company’s products, including BUX Crypto which allows users to invest in real cryptocurrencies, and BUX X, where users can trade in contracts for difference (CFDs), are available across Europe. 
 BUX announced that it has raised $80 million in a funding round led by Prosus Ventures and Tencent, with participation from additional new investors ABN Amro Ventures, Citius, Optiver, and Endeit Capital. 
Royal Park Partners acted as exclusive financial advisor to BUX and its shareholders throughout the transaction.
 With this new funding round, BUX will continue to spearhead innovation by implementing advanced features to further shape the future of how Europeans invest. 
 We are extremely grateful to have top tier investors like Prosus Ventures and Tencent onboard to support us in our mission”, said Yorick Naeff, BUX’s new CEO. 
The investment will enable BUX to accelerate the expansion of its commission-free investment app BUX Zero.
 Recently, BUX extended its partnership with enterprise connectivity platform Yapily to France and Austria. 
 The new collaboration will enable French and Austrian BUX Zero users, along with German users to fund their accounts and build an investment portfolio. 
 He added, “BUX has built the next generation of investing services that are low cost, convenient and intuitive for even the newest investor, while covering the full spectrum of investment options, including cryptocurrencies.

 Before the two fintechs joined forces, BUX Zero’s customers had to fund their investment accounts via bank transfer. 
Commission-free investment platform BUX and financial API provider Yapily have deepened their budding partnership.
The two fintechs have extended their current offering to enable BUX Zero users to add money to their accounts more easily in both France and Austria.
BUX Zero users in Germany already benefit from the collaboration with Yapily and now their neighbours in France and Austria will be able to top up their accounts from their mobile banking apps.
 Nick Bortot, founder and CEO of BUX, said:   Efficiency and high usability are the core of BUX Zero, which we clearly prove by integrating the Yapily API. 
BUX Zero is the first choice for these investors because it offers the right solution for this target group.”
 Bortot went on to add that he hopes, by joining forces with Yapily he and the BUX team will be able to roll out its signature commission-free trading product across Europe. 
 Before the partnership, BUX’s customers in France and Austria funded their accounts via bank transfer, with the funds often taking one working day on average to arrive. 
 Stefano Vaccino, CEO of Yapily, added: “Drawing on our open banking expertise, we have rolled out connectivity in three countries - Germany, France and Austria - which allows regional Bux Zero users to receive a better in-app experience.” 
We look forward to continuing our work with Bux across Europe.”
 BUX has also continued to expand across Europe, with Germany quickly becoming a key market for the Dutch fintech, amassing 100,000 customers in the country just two months after launching. 
 The investment platform has been busily rolling out its BUX Zero platform across Europe, launching it in Austria and Germany in June, France in July and Belgium in August.

 Amy Biancolli: Adele Framer, thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. 
 Adele Framer: Hi, Amy, thanks for having me, I appreciate it. 
Framer: I realized immediately it wasn’t a relapse.
 Framer: People feel them in different ways, but I’ll tell you how I feel them. 
 Framer: First of all, all psychotropics—a prescribed psychotropic, a psychotropic that’s not prescribed, street drugs—if you take [a psychotropic] regularly, your nervous system will adapt to it. 
 Framer: Right, even if it’s brain zaps and nausea and insomnia. 
Framer: A lot the symptoms seem to be autonomic.
 Framer: From our experience, we believe that the severity of withdrawal syndrome is related to the rate of tapering—and this makes sense. 
Framer: That’s a question that as far back as I can remember patients have been asking each other.
 Adele Framer: I’m glad you brought that up, Amy. 
 Adele Framer: Well, yeah, that’s been a tradition for 20 years. 
 Framer: When people read other people’s stories, they realize that they’re not the only person that’s experiencing that problem. 
 Framer: In my opinion, where stigma about so-called mental illness radiates the most intensely is in the medical profession. 
 Adele Framer: Recently there have been some developments in the UK that were spearheaded by the patient movement and have gotten some traction in the British government, some recognition in British psychiatry, [which] may influence the national guidelines and also the European guidelines for the treatment of depression. 
 Biancolli: Thank you, Adele Framer, for all of this.

This Miniseries will introduce you to the ‘70’s and ‘80’s (or bring back memories) and to an icon of the late 20th century who was both a framer and a product of his time.
 One is your framer, another is your architect and the judge is hearing the case in which you spent way too much on beams, or even worse, your lawyer is going over the damages of cracking and sagging ceilings and walls. 
 The state grants a license, upon proof of a rigorous education followed by an internship and one of the longest exams given to show competence, not to your framer, but to the architect. 
 Your County Office of Consumer Affairs, which licenses contractors, not framers, can confirm what the qualifications are: no formal educational background, no particular experience, not even an exam. 
Your framer gets elevated to the status of a licensed professional by you and you alone.
 He may be smart, even experienced, but the call isn’t for him to make, any more than a couch potato making the calls for a professional football team.There are no consequences for framers whether they’re right or wrong. 
 Framers can say anything, and they often do, confusing homeowners into believing their bold, unsubstantiated claims and calling into doubt the designated professional’s judgment or competence. 
It sounds more like your framer is flexing his ego to you instead of speaking to the architect.
 Framer, the Amsterdam-based startup behind interactive design platform Framer X, has raised $24 million in Series B investment. 
It brings the total raised to date by Framer to $33 million.
 Founded by ex-Facebookers Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk, Framer has set out to ride (and power) a trend that is seeing every company having to become a digital business and often a product-first company, as consumers become accustomed to high-quality apps and other desirable digital experiences. 
 To that end, Framer X is described as a “fully integrated design, prototyping and developer handoff tool” that makes it easy to create app designs and prototypes that are as visually polished as a production app. 
 Designs created in Framer X are powered by the React framework, and the platform enables a lot of off-the-shelf interactivity, rather than prototypes simply being static wireframes or designs with limited transitions or hotspots. 
 However, as explained during a video presentation by Bok and Dijk, what potentially sets Framer X apart from other competing app design and prototyping tools is that you can also import production components and assets into the software for re-use so that designers aren’t continually re-inventing the wheel. 
 Via the “Framer X Store,” these React-based components can also come from and be shared by the wider developer community. 
 This means that Framer is attempting to be a platform play in the true sense of the word, while in turn the Framer X Store is a clever way of creating network effects. 
 Related to this, the company is announcing the beta launch of a private design store for teams on Framer X. The Team Store enables members of teams at the same company to collaborate and share brand assets, design components and more, so as to allow for internal interactive design systems to also live within the Framer platform. 
 Those teams are already using Framer X. We are excited about partnering with Koen, Jorn and the Framer team to help make that level of digital product excellence and innovation accessible to any company in any traditional industry, from financial services to retail and beyond.” 
 Meanwhile, the Framer founding backstory is worth noting. 
 However, seeing an opportunity to help more companies transition to becoming digital-first and product-led, the pair left to found Framer in 2014. 
 Just about any framer, form builder or scaffold erector that has been swinging a hammer as part of his livelihood can tell you that, at some point in their career, they have suffered from joint and muscle pain in their hammering arm. 
 Framer X design tool steps in the ring with InVision, Adobe, and Sketch 
 Framer X, a revamped version of three-year-old Framer, was founded by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk after the duo sold design software Sofa to Facebook in 2011. 
 Framer X is a rich, React-based design tool that lets any designer draw out their interface components and instantly send them over to the engineering team for collaboration. 
 With Framer X, engineers can send over existing components that are in production and let designers move forward from there. 
 Framer X also allows users to collect components and other design items as a package within the Framer X store, so that they’re easily accessible during the design process. 
Framer X offers a public Framer X Store where casual designers can build off of the experience of advanced designers who’ve uploaded components to the store.
 Framer costs $15/month for users, and private Framer X stores for the enterprise are priced flexibly based on the size of the organization. 
 Framer now joins a competitive landscape, which includes the likes of InVision, Adobe, and Sketch. 
 Framer has raised $9 million to date from Greylock, Foundation Capital, Designer Fund, and Accel Europe.

 Best for Comfort 4 Dead On DO-FR Framers Rig Photo: amazon.com Check Latest Price One of the main gripes with tool belts is their tendency to sag and shift under the weight of tools, which inevitably causes painful chafing. 
 Dead On Tools’ Framers Rig features a substantial set of suspenders with heavy padding that extends from the shoulder blades around the shoulders and across the chest, ensuring you won’t be hiking up your belt every few minutes or suffering from aching shoulders by day’s end. 
 Best High-Capacity 5 Bucket Boss Mullet Buster 3 Bag Tool Belt Photo: amazon.com Check Latest Price Carry all the tools you need with this tool belt from Bucket Boss, which boasts 29 pockets with numerous large- and medium-size pouches, which is more than most framers rigs. 
 It features three large pockets, each with enough space to carry a framer’s square, a box of drill bits, a screwdriver, a set of pliers, and other hand tools. 
 Thus, setting up of these systems involve huge costs, which are difficult for a traditional framer to afford. 
Low-code dev platform Framer things it has the answer in its new Playground platform.
 Framer, makers of the low-code development platform Framer X, have announced a new tool to help designers and developers meet in the middle: Framer X Playground. 
 Playground is   the first creative coding environment built specifically with designers in mind,   said Koen Bok, co-founder and CEO of Framer. 
What Framer hopes it can do is further bridge that gap by building an all-in-one development tool with both a code backend and a designer-focused low code environment.
Framer X itself is a low-code tool with a plethora of design elements that can be automatically added to projects.
 One of the key components of Framer X is its built-in store of actual production components, which developers can add for designers to manipulate however they see fit. 
 Playground is a supplement to Framer X that Framer believes makes it even better at helping   product teams around the world understand how to collaborate in new ways, to shorten and refine their product's lifecycle,   Framer's Addison Schultz said. 
 The Framer library is being made open source, which makes frames and stacks easier to implement, 
 Framer X Playground is built on JavaScript ES6 and React, and can also be combined with any other JavaScript framework, so it should be usable for a wide variety of projects. 
Bad news for those not operating a Mac-based shop: Framer's software is only available for macOS.
 For those that use Apple hardware Framer X could be an essential tool in connecting developers and design teams, and Playground can make it even moreso. 
If you're interested in trying out Framer X and Playground you can download the latest beta version of Framer X (which includes Playground) and give it a try.
 If you decide to stick with Framer X, it will cost you: Individual plans start at $12 USD/month (billed annually), and a group license for five seats is $79 USD/month, also billed annually. 
You'll have no issue cranking all settings up high and enjoying stable high framer rates at Full HD.

 MANILA, Philippines — With continuing attacks against lawyers, the arrests and killings of activists and rampant red-tagging, Constitutional Framer Ed Garcia, also a petitioner against the Anti-Terrorism Act, said it is time to “transform outrage into courage.” 
 The Constitutional Framer stressed that the primary task of human rights defenders across the globe is to “demonstrate defiant hope, to conspire, keep hope alive, reinvent resistance, reimagine our future.”

 3D Hubs, the online manufacturing services platform, announced it has rebranded to ‘Hubs‘. 
 Early this year, Protolabs, a global technology-enabled online manufacturing leader, acquired Hubs (then 3D Hubs). 
 About Hubs: Hubs, formerly 3D Hubs, is an online manufacturing platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of manufacturing partners. 
 Online manufacturing platform 3D Hubs, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, has changed its name to Hubs, in order to reposition the company as one offering a wide range of manufacturing services.

 “3D Hubs’ company culture lives and breathes engineering and fast-paced innovation; our team is very excited to partner with Protolabs to build the best on-demand manufacturing solution imaginable,” added Brian Garret, 3D Hubs’ Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. 
Protolabs has also established an employee incentive fund payable to 3D Hubs employees based on achievement of both financial performance and employee retention targets.
Protolabs now anticipates the acquisition of 3D Hubs will accelerate its revenue growth rate and be marginally dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2021.
3D Hubs’ 2020 revenue is estimated to be $25 million and the company’s revenue has had a compound annual growth rate of over 200% since 2017.

 The global 3D printing market grew by 21 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 to an estimated value of $12.6 billion despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to on-demand manufacturing platform 3D Hubs’ 2021 3D Printing Trends Report. 
The 3D printing market forecast within 3D Hubs’ 3D Printing Trends Report summarizes 2020 data from nine market analyst firms.
 The latest edition of 3D Hubs’ 3D Printing Trends Report seeks to review the overall market growth of additive manufacturing, including the impact of Covid-19, alongside revealing where demand is highest for the technology and the barriers to adoption it still faces. 
 The report is comprised of data from three main sources, including a survey conducted by 3D Hubs with 1,504 engineering businesses. 
 The effect of Covid-19 on 3D printing usage via 3D Hubs’ survey, conducted February 2021. 
 According to 3D Hubs’ report, 3D printing gained “mainstream exposure” for its role in rapidly producing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and components for medical devices such as ventilators. 
 The survey carried out by 3D Hubs reveals that, as a result of the pandemic, 33 percent of engineering businesses increased their 3D printing usage, while half of the 1,504 respondents maintained their usage. 
 3D printed parts produced by application, via 3D Hubs’ survey, conducted February 2021. 
 According to 3D Hubs’ survey, 47 percent of engineering businesses deploy 3D printing for prototyping while 29 percent use the technology for aesthetic or functional end-use parts. 
 Barriers to implementing 3D printing more, via 3D Hubs’ survey, conducted February 2021. 
 However, cost, part quality, limited expertise, and material choice limitations are all factors holding back the adoption of additive manufacturing, according to respondents of 3D Hubs’ survey. 
 Rounding off its report, 3D Hubs asked more than 1,500 3D printing users in its community to predict how they foresee the industry evolving throughout 2021. 
The full Additive Manufacturing Trends Report 2021 from 3D Hubs can be read in full here.

3D printed parts remain exempt from this change because 3D Hubs has re-emphasized its commitment to exclusively local manufacturing partners.
3D Hubs provides third-party logistics and design processing to its clients.
3D Hubs already provides a user-friendly online platform for computer-aided design order quotes and entry.
The new system is two-tiered and based on 3D Hubs’ current production schedule.
 CNC, injection molding and sheet metal fabrication, which require ample shop space, are shipped through one of 3D Hubs’ new hubs. 
3D Hubs institute double quality control by routing manufacturing runs through its hubs.
 3D Hubs has committed, moreover, to twenty-four-hour turnaround time between parts arriving at its centralized shipping centers and shipping to clients. 
 3D Hubs is capitalizing on global uncertainty because, as global supply chains re-organize in the post-COVID world, manufacturing borne out of centralized shipping hubs cuts production costs. 
 The 3D printing services offered under 3D Hubs’ platform, moreover, create local opportunities for small manufacturers, which encourages the adoption rate of small-to-large additive manufacturing systems. 
3D Hubs’ announcement establishes the company as a leader in centralized shipping in the manufacturing sector.
 Proto Labs Inc., a long-time provider of several digital manufacturing services available for order through its ecommerce site, has added 3D Hubs Inc.’s online platform and global network of 240 manufacturers. 
 By acquiring 3D Hubs, Protolabs says it is gaining “a complementary network of manufacturing partners to fulfill a breadth of capabilities outside of its current envelope, and a broader selection of pricing and lead time options.” 
 Protolabs added that its own and 3D Hubs’ “customer offerings are very complementary, and this expansion of services and capabilities reinforces Protolabs’ commitment to delight its customers and become the go-to supplier in the global custom contract manufacturing market.” 
 Proto Labs, Inc., (Protolabs) a global provider of digital manufacturing services headquartered in Maple Plain, Minnesota, USA, has entered into an agreement to acquire 3D Hubs, Inc., an online platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of approximately 240 premium manufacturing partners.

On-demand digital manufacturing provider Protolabs has revealed that the additional revenue provided by its acquisition of 3D Hubs has aided a return to growth during Q1 2021.
 The company’s decision to buy 3D Hubs has allowed it to reap almost immediate rewards in Q1 2021, increasing the firm’s addressable market by 25%, and its number of unique product developers to 22,605. 
 “During the first quarter of 2021, we achieved two very important milestones, the successful launch of Protolabs 2.0 and the transformative acquisition of 3D Hubs, which will enable us to accelerate growth,” said Bodor. 
 Although the firm hasn’t broken down exactly how many additive manufacturing-related sales have resulted from its 3D Hubs acquisition, it’s understood to have brought in $5.8 million, potentially making it a significant growth-driver in this area. 
 According to Bodor, Protolabs’ acquisition of 3D Hubs in January 2021 enabled it to build “a complementary network of manufacturing partners,” that not only allowed its new subsidiary to generate 35% higher revenue in Q1 2021 than it did in Q1 2020, but to incorporate 3D Hubs’ network of 240 partners and wide machine portfolio into its own, extending its customer reach and manufacturing capabilities. 
A further $50 million could also be forked over should 3D Hubs meet targets during the next two years.
Protolabs expanded on its production capabilities by acquiring 3D Hubs in January 2021.
 “We managed our financial performance very well in the first quarter through the Protolabs 2.0 systems launch and acquisition of 3D Hubs,” concluded Way. 
 Contract manufacturer Protolabs reached an agreement to acquire online manufacturing platform 3D Hubs for $280 million, company officials announced. 
 Protolabs said the deal would add 3D Hubs' global network of about 240 manufacturers to its operations, along with broader manufacturing, pricing, and lead-time options. 
 3D Hubs, based in Amsterdam, says its network has procured more than 6 million custom parts since its founding in 2013.

Above: Impact of Covid-19 on 3D printing usage/Image Source: 3D Hubs
 This optimism is also backed by a survey conducted by 3D Hubs that concluded that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, 33 percent of engineering businesses increased their 3D printing usage, and 50 percent of engineering businesses maintained their usage. 
 Disruption to overseas sourcing also caused more engineering businesses to consider increasing their 3D printing usage, as lead times for machined and injection moulded parts were too long, and chose either to print in-house or outsource to a local 3D printing company or service bureaus such as 3D Hubs. 
About 3D Hubs: 3D Hubs is an online manufacturing platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of manufacturing partners.
 Founded in Amsterdam in 2013, 3D Hubs was acquired by Protolabs in January 2021.

 Catawiki, a European online marketplace for specialized objects has announced a €150 million investment, led by Permira through its Growth Opportunities Fund. 
 Catawiki aims to use the money raised to invest in technology, marketing and hiring more experts across Europe to grow their user base and further their expansion. 
The Covid-19 lockdown has spurred a growth in sales at Dutch auction site Catawiki.com.
 As a result, an executive at the company announced that Catawiki expects to achieve profitability this year. 
 Much of Catawiki’s growth came from a surge in commissions on sales of watches, collectibles, art and design products. 
 Last year, Catawiki’s net losses fell 63% to €4.6 million ($5.2 million U.S.), compared to €12.5 million ($14 million U.S.) in 2018. 
 In an interview with De Telegraaf, Catawiki’s chief commercial officer, Frederik de Beer, predicted that the company would turn a profit this year. 
 Founded in 2008, Catawiki operates auction sites across the globe. 
Catawiki has raised around $95 million U.S. in funding over four rounds.
You can find this particular lot here https://www.catawiki.com/l/38296221
The auction will be online starting Friday 28 August 2020 at 10:00 UTC | closing Thursday 10th September 2020 at 18:01 UTC and will be visible at the following link: https://www.catawiki.com/a/383985

 As an example of the variety of world coins available on Catawiki, another recent highlight is this seven-coin mint set from China. 
 Of course, more rare and intriguing coins, medals and banknotes are available at Catawiki, so be sure to check out their other upcoming listings before they close.

 Previously the coin was auctioned by Morton & Eden and Roma Numismatics, and now it is offered at Catawiki without a reserve price. 
 Besides these two Roman aurei, the Catawiki Ancient Coins Exclusive Selection auction includes several other aurei (of Trajan and Antoninus Pius), an impressive selection of high-grade Macedonian tetradrachms, and several Byzantine solidi gold coins, so make sure to run an eye over the auction!

 Meanwhile, Catawiki experts offer sellers support whether they are selling individual items or moving their entire inventory online, often in a matter of days. 
Catawiki has also helped sellers navigate the pandemic.
 Though Catawiki offers books and works on paper at a variety of price points, the platform has also increasingly focused on higher value items and themed sales. 
 For example, Catawiki recently held a multi-seller auction of 70 Bibles in many languages and styles dated from 1493 onwards, though most lots originated from a single private collection.The lots realized an average sale price of €700 or $830. 
 On November 6, Catawiki also launched an exclusive Book, Map,and Manuscript auction, which featured many rare finds, including a court summons issued to Emile Zola from when he appealed a defamation conviction related to the Alfred Dreyfus case. 
 As of printing, results have not yet been realized, but Catawiki expects strong sales throughout the auction. 
 However, due to the popularity of this first exclusive sale with sellers, Catawiki already plans to hold regular exclusive book and manuscript auctions, the next of which will begin November 27 at 10 UTC and will end on December 6 at 18:01 UTC. 
 Before that sale, Catawiki will also hold another themed auction from November 13 at 10 UTC until November 25 at 18:01 UTC centering on the works of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda from a collection Harrison calls “one of the most comprehensive to come to market in recent years.” 
 No matter what price point buyers or sellers are looking for, Catawiki’s unique structure opens up the world of collecting to everyone. 
 Catawiki.com offers a range of collectibles including jewelry, fine art, stamps, comics, toys, antiques, wine, and military orders, decorations, and medals. 
 Catawiki estimates that this lot will go for between €13,750 and €15,250 (between $16,442 and $18,237 USD). 
 Catawiki gives an estimate of €850 to €950 (about $1,015-$1,134 USD). 
 Many more rare and fascinating coins, medals and banknotes are available at Catawiki, so be sure to check out their other upcoming listings before they close. 
The auction will be online from Friday 24 July 2020 at 10:00 (CET) until Tuesday 04 August 2020 at 18:00 CET and will be visible at the following link: https://www.catawiki.com/a/366413

An incredibly rare copy of the retro LEGO Western set 6765 Gold City Junction is currently up for auction at Catawiki.
Brick Fanatics has partnered with Catawiki to highlight some of the auction website’s most extraordinary LEGO-related listings.
 Whether you’re interested in expanding your retro collection or just have one eye on LEGO odds and ends, there’s plenty to tempt you to part with your hard-earned cash at Catawiki. 
 The 350-piece 6765 Gold City Junction originally rolled into town in 1995 for around $50, but it’s rare enough now that Catawiki’s experts reckon this sealed copy will sell for roughly €310 to €350. 
 If you prefer your retro LEGO tinged with a hint of exclusivity, Catawiki’s merchants have your back with this novelty oversized Aquanaut minifigure, which scales up the traditional plastic people by roughly 500%. 
 At the moment, the promo is set to fetch at least €50 through Catawiki, but with more than four days left on the auction at the time of writing, that price could easily climb higher.

An incredibly rare LEGO Inside Tour set and a 40th anniversary LEGO Star Wars model are currently up for auction at Catawiki.
Brick Fanatics has partnered with Catawiki to highlight some of the auction website’s most notable LEGO-related listings.
If you’re looking for a flagship piece for your LEGO collection – the kind that will make your fellow fans green with envy – you could do much worse than checking out what Catawiki has up for grabs at the moment.
 That means they’re pretty much impossible to find on the aftermarket, making the copy up for grabs at Catawiki essentially the LEGO equivalent of the crown jewels. 
 You can expect to pay a pretty penny for it as a result, with the current bid standing at €1,200 (and Catawiki’s experts estimating a final sale value of €1,500 to €2,500). 
 Fortunately, you’ve now got another chance to grab a mint-in-sealed-box copy of the showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader – you know, the one that culminated in an intergalactic version of Jeremy Kyle – through Catawiki. 
 Catawiki, a Dutch online auction business, has raised $82 million to scale its business on the continent and beyond. 
 Catawiki is not disclosing revenues or user numbers (or valuation, for that matter) but it does note that over the last 12 months, it has increased revenues by 300 percent and doubled its number of auction categories, and now sells over 15,000 lots per week. 
While eBay has moved away from auctions as the core of its services — selling many items and often at “Buy it now” prices — Catawiki has developed an auction-only system that runs like clockwork.
 He says that in tests run by Catawiki, objects that start selling at €1 see much more activity, and ultimately end up at higher prices, than when that same object’s bidding starts at a higher number. 
Another area where Catawiki has helped build trust in its platform through its approach to transacting on its site.
 Sellers are vetted by Catawiki, and items are also periodically inspected by experts to assess them as authentic. 
 Then, when someone wins an auction, their money is held in escrow by Catawiki until the seller receives and accepts the item. 
 Schoenmakers says that while Catawiki was profitable until its Series B — a €10 million investment in September 2014 — it is now in “investment mode,” aka in the red. 
 It’s not clear if Catawiki will stick to its structure quite so steadfastly as it grows and competes with more local players, but this is what has helped it get to where it is today, investors say. 
 “Catawiki’s curated offering intrigued us, but we were really impressed by the company’s enormous addressable market, highly capital efficient business model and buyers and sellers’ love of the platform as demonstrated through remarkable unit economics. 
We look forward to helping Catawiki build a global online auction platform.”
 While a lot of the focus on e-commerce juggernauts in Europe has been around areas like food delivery and the Rocket Internet incubator, Catawiki underscores how online auctions are still alive and well. 
 Catawiki may not yet be a household name outside of Europe, but the Accel-backed online auction house is one of the region’s fastest growing startups.

Rutherford County Historian Receives NSDAR’s Historic Preservation Medal
 As part of these challenges, you’ll need to earn a Melee Master Medal in CoD Mobile, so here’s how to complete it. 
How to Get the Melee Master Medal in CoD Mobile
 To get the Melee Master Medal, players must get four kills with a melee weapon in a single match. 
 Another quick tip to help you get the Melee Master Medal fast is to select ‘Classic’ from the BR settings screen, and then choose ‘Solo’ and ‘FPP’ from the bottom of the screen. 
 While this may take some getting used to, we recommend doing this because you’ve got a higher chance of getting bots in this less popular mode, making it easier to get the four melee kills you need to earn the medal. 
 Upon earning the Melee Master medal, you’ll tick off some of your progress towards the new Razor Sharp Seasonal Challenge. 
 This medal, in particular, earns players the unique Punk Skull spray, and completing all of the Razor Sharp challenges will earn players the Sickle, a rather stylish melee weapon. 
Earn the Melee Master Medal once in BR Matches (excluding Warfare)

 Mr Laffer, a former economic adviser to Ronald Reagan who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Mr Trump in 2019, immediately faced criticism for his remarks about low wage employees. 
The medals created by the John Jacob Astor Fur Company showed Astor (the company president) on the obverse while the reverse has shaking hands with overlapping peace pipes and tomahawks.
 This privately struck American Fur Company silver peace medal meant to replicate the Peace medals produced by the U.S. government was produced around 1832 and sold for $144,000 on April 22. 
A coveted piece from the Donald G. Partrick Collection in Heritage’s April 22 auction in Dallas was the illustrated circa 1832 John Jacob Astor American Fur Company silver medal graded About Uncirculated 55 by Numismatic Guaranty Corp.
This was a privately struck “peace medal” designed to be used as a gift to strengthen ties with North American Indigenous populations.
 The design of the medals was described by Heritage as “a blatant imitation of the standard federal Indian peace medal design,” since the U.S. government was not willing to allow a private commercial entity to issue medals on its behalf. 
Contemporary documents establish that the medals were given out by the summer of 1837.
Heritage lists the offered medal as likely the example sold to the Astor Family circa 1893 and later sold at Stack’s John J. Ford Jr.

History Buffs Rejoice: Beautiful Thomas Jefferson Medal Comes To Auction
 From the same collection as the two fabulous Libertas Americana medals that I wrote up in a previous PR Power comes an 1801 Thomas Jefferson Inaugural Medal in silver, one of only about a dozen pieces known to exist in any grade! 
The 1801 Jefferson Inaugural medal was struck in both silver and white metal to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Jefferson's ascent to the office of the presidency.
 Catalogued by R.W. Julian as PR-2, these 1801 Jefferson medals were produced at the behest of Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Henry Voigt, a staunch supporter of Jefferson, and engraved by then-newcomer John Reich of Germany. 
 In the world of medals and exonumia collecting, the silver versions are almost always more valuable than either bronze or white metal due to their typically lower mintages. 
That is certainly true of this lovely medal!
 The medal was likely wiped lightly long ago, with minor hairlines beneath the lovely overlay. 
 Simply put, the importance and historic nature of this remarkable medallic offering cannot be overstated. 
This medal would have cross-category appeal to Historical/Americana bidders.

 As the Olympics near with each passing day, we bring to you a new series of articles, 'Behind an Olympic medal', wherein we will take you through the struggles that went behind Olympic medals won by India. 
 For the third article of this series, we take you through shuttler PV Sindhu's silver medal finish at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 
 Despite sending its largest-ever contingent in their Olympic history to Rio, the country returned with only two medals, one of which was from PV Sindhu in badminton. 
 Entering Rio de Janeiro, not many considered the then 21-year-old PV Sindhu to be a medal contender. 
The 2012 London Games bronze medallist Saina Nehwal was seeded fifth.
 She was the one who was expected to lead India to the glory, while Sindhu was just an understudy – someone who could use this Olympics as a learning curve and win a medal at the next edition. 
 In a match that lasted nearly 83 minutes, the Indian went down 21-19, 12-21, 15-21 to settle for the silver medal. 
 Since becoming the first-ever Indian woman to win a silver medal at Olympics, PV Sindhu has grown heaps and bounds and was even named the World Champion in the year 2019. 
 As a slender 158-pound college student by his own admission, he won gold medals in the men's 400 meters and the men's 4x400 meter relay at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games in world and Olympic Games record-setting times. 
Mr. Evans is the university's first and only two-time Olympic Games gold medal winner.Lee Evans was the first person to run 400 meters under 44.0 seconds with his winning time of 43.86.
The gold-medal winning 400-meter time remained a world record until 1988 and the 4x400 relay world mark stood until 1992.The winning performances were in the shadow of controversy.
 Approaching the victory stand following his 400-meter victory, Mr. Evans, silver medalist Larry James and bronze medalist Ron Freeman wore black berets as their sign of support for the Olympic Project for Human Rights.For his gold medal-winning performances, he was named Track & Field News' U.S. College Athlete of the Year. 
His Olympic gold medal will always be a source of pride for all Spartans.

Amsterdam-based fitness app company Virtuagym has raised $7 million (6 million euros) in its second round of funding.
   Technology is gaining momentum in the health and fitness industry,   Hugo Braam, CEO of Virtuagym, said in a statement. 
 Founded in 2008 by Braam and his brother Paul Braam, Virtuagym offers a consumer-facing app for iOS and Android devices, as well as a professional app geared at gyms, health clubs, and personal trainers. 
 A second app, Virtuagym Food, includes a calorie, carb, and fat counter, and the two apps can share data between them. 
 Virtuagym plans to use the funding to promote international expansion, strengthening its market presence in Europe and the Americas. 
   Technology is transforming the way consumers interact with health and fitness clubs as well as their professionals and we believe that Virtuagym is uniquely positioned to tap into this,   ​Hubert Deitmers, cofounder and managing partner of Endeit Capital, said in a statement. 
   With their innovative and wide-ranging solutions for health clubs, trainers, and studios, Virtuagym has achieved significant traction in this huge and growing market, both in Europe and the US. 
 This, combined with its founders' vision and the company's ambitious outlook on product development, convinced us to assist Virtuagym’s roll-out and build a category leader. 
 By analysing the data of over 6,000 European fitness clubs with almost five million members, Virtuagym, a provider of online and mobile coaching technology for fitness businesses, suggests that despite large revenue drops in March and April, gyms have almost recovered their revenue levels in July - and have more members than in January this year. 
 The news comes as Virtuagym conducted wider research into the short and long-term consequences of COVID-19, measuring KPI data from memberships, attendance, club performance, revenue, app usage trends, and more. 
 Virtuagym Chief Executive, Hugo Braam advises “it is great to see the resilience of our industry and at the same time how fitness entrepreneurs adapt through the adoption of digital services. 
 Virtuagym’s data shows that in April, the industry was at an all-time low in terms of memberships. 
 In April, the revenue of fitness businesses in the Virtuagym system dropped to 58% compared to February. 
Virtuagym data found that bookings reduced to 86% during COVID-19.

 Dutch startup Virtuagym, which makes fitness apps aimed at both consumers and fitness professionals, has picked up €2.1 million in new funding. 
 Hugo Braam, CEO and co-founder of Virtuagym, says the company will use the new capital to speed up international growth and “further invest in the development of our products and services for our clients, which include gyms, trainers and corporate health services.” 
 To date, Virtuagym says its app and cloud-based software have been used by over 7 million consumers and 1,800 businesses. 
 “Virtuagym’s primary mission is that we want to enable people to live healthier, more active lives, through the support of new technology,” Braam tells TechCrunch.

 Virtuagym logo As a front-runner in the space we've been promoting technology for over a decade now, and it's great to see the market finally shifting. 
 Founded by two brothers, Paul and Hugo Braam, Virtuagym has grown from a single-room start-up to a scale-up with over 200 employees and offices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Medellín, Colombia. 
Swedish social gaming platform Hiberworld.com announced its first major milestone as the total number of created games on the Hiber platform crossed one million.
 Owned and operated by Hiber, Hiberworld.com allows players to make their own games and 3D experiences, publishing them in minutes without any complex coding. 
 “The road to the first million games really began to take shape when we released touch creation on mobile devices in October 2019,” said Mattias Johansson Hiber's chief innovation officer.

European satellite and communications startup Hiber BV has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand its IoT satellite network.
Hiber’s satellite constellation tracks and monitors machines and devices in harder-to-reach places.
 At the same time, co-founder of Hiber Laurens Groenendijk is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives,” the company said in a statement. 
 Coen Janssen, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector. 
 In particular, because it can reach out-of-the-way areas, Hiber’s network may be able to reduce losses in food production and leakages from oil wells. 
This equity financing will help Hiber to enable affordable and ubiquitous connectivity for the IoT solutions.”
 In a unanimous decision authored by Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman and joined by Circuit Judges David S. Tatel and David B. Sentelle, the panel rejected a petition by non-U.S. licensed satellite operators Telesat, Eutelsat, Hiber, Kineis and Inmarsat to vacate the FCC's order. 
Hiber has raised $2.25 million in a second round of seed funding for its web platform that makes it easy to create user-generated games.
 The Gothenberg, Sweden-based company has quietly amassed more than 300,000 games from 250,000 monthly active users for its HiberWorld platform. 
 “We were coming out at the worst possible time you could,” Hiber CEO Michael Yngfors said in an interview with GamesBeat. 
 Hiber isn’t anywhere near as large as Minecraft or Roblox, which are popular user-generated game worlds with users in the hundreds of millions. 
And Hiber can target markets with very low bandwidth or low-end computer hardware.
 With the proliferation of HTML5, WebGL, PWA, and WebAssembly, and growing storage capabilities attached to browsers, the core technology to develop and launch HiberWorld has been in place and evolving for a couple of years. 
 Then, by saving the location of the assets and their functionality, Hiber can replay them for others on the game portal. 
 Hiber has been growing rapidly since adding requested features to its platform, including multiplayer, chat with friends, player homeworlds (personal game spaces), playgrounds (public play spaces), and the capability to play and create your own shooter game. 
Sybo CEO Mathias Gredal Nørvig has joined Hiber’s board of directors.
He said in a statement that he feels like Hiber could help change the way a generation communicates through games.
 Yngfors said the name Hiber is a reference to the Latin root of hibernation, or dreaming. 
Hiberworld is a web-based platform for creating interactive virtual experiences.
 “This is all thanks to our fantastic community, you continue to amaze us with your creativity,” developer Hiber stated, also saying that it is now adding over 130 new items and 10 new environments to the platform. 
 Hiberworld allows users to create their own games, 3D hangouts, playgrounds, interactive scenes, showcases, and virtual worlds without the need to code. 
 “The road to the first million games really began to take shape when we released touch creation on mobile devices in October 2019,” Hiber co-founder Mattias Johansson said. 
 Hiberworld offers users different social features, including chat, likes, followers, and comments. 
 AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dutch satellite Internet-of-Things (IoT) solution startup, Hiber, today announces the launch of HiberHilo, its first end-to-end solution for Oil & Gas Well Integrity Monitoring. 
HiberHilo is also the world’s first subscription service for IoT-enabled remote Oil/Gas Well monitoring and the company will be introducing similar services for other specific use cases in 2021.
 Having already been one of the first firms to develop a remote IoT connectivity solution with the launch of its proprietary nano-satellites in 2018, Hiber identified the urgent need for readily available out-the-box end-to-end subscription based offerings. 
 The HiberHilo solution for Oil & Gas Well Integrity Monitoring is the first offering of this kind that Hiber will launch because this process is currently complex, time-consuming and expensive (costing up to $40,000 per field visit). 
 HiberHilo’s out-of-the-box subscription solution utilises Hiber’s global satellite network to empower organisations to automate continuous annulus pressure and wellhead monitoring of up to 250 wells in a radius of 10km, even in the most remote locations on Earth. 
 Coen Janssen, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Hiber said, “We are excited to launch this first-of-its-kind IoT proposition for remote monitoring at a time when it is needed more than ever. 
HiberHilo has already been proven by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) and Royal Dutch Shell (better known as just “Shell”) on an abandoned on-shore well.
 Hiber entered the market in 2018 purely as a connectivity provider, utilising its own proprietary nano-satellite technology to unlock IoT connectivity in the 90% of the world without it. 
For more information on HiberHilo visit: hiberhilo.com or watch this video.
 Hiber is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution startup, founded and led by a dream team of satellite experts and tech entrepreneurs. 
These 'Hibernauts' are working on a moonshoot goal: to launch and provide end-to-end IoT solutions connected by satellites in space.
More than 55 employees work on the ground-breaking technology behind Hiber and Hiberband at its offices in the Netherlands and USA.
 This has meant that in November 2018 Hiber became the Netherlands’ first commercial satellite company, launching its first two nano-satellites into orbit. 
Hiber officially launched at the Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Re:invent Conference in November 2018 where they were named Commercial Startup Launch of 2018 at the AWS conference.
 IoT solutions provider Hiber has successfully launched their 3U cubesat, Hiber Four, onboard SpaceX’s dedicated rideshare mission: Transporter-1. 
 “By using our high-performance green propulsion technology, Hiber Four is able to take advantage of the world’s most cost-effective launch whilst maintaining independence and operational flexibility”, said Stefan Powell, CTO of Dawn Aerospace. 
 Supported by the European Space Agency and Netherlands Space Office via the ARTES program, Hiber teamed up with Dawn and Hyperion to find a better solution. 
 Using this new system, the Hiber Four will swiftly move from its deployed 500 km SSO out to its final 600 km orbit. 
Hiber is setting the standard for responsible satellite operations.
 Once on orbit, the Hiber Four can easily avoid space debris, increase its lifetime by raising orbit, and when ready to decommission, Hiber can deorbit within days instead of months. 
 Hiber Four is the first of two identical satellites Hiber plans to launch this quarter, with the next one launching on Soyuz. 
 These satellites will join the Hiberband constellation to expand offerings to existing customers, particularly those from the oil & gas, transportation and agricultural industries. 
 “It is revolutionary to the cubesat market,” said Maarten Engelen, CTO of Hiber. 
 A partnership with Hiber, named AWS’ Commercial Start-Up Launch of the Year in 2018 and Dutch National Icon in 2019, shows a promising path forward for sustainability in the Aerospace industry. 
 Hiber, a Dutch ‘New Space’ startup, has a new heavy equipment monitoring solution that helps increase productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
HiberHeavy is a subscription-based IoT solution.
 HiberHeavy is a heavy equipment monitoring solution that is subscription-based, easy to install, and operates anywhere in the world. 
 With HiberHeavy, mining, agriculture, and construction sites can increase productivity with better data and analytics on their heavy equipment, and is Hiber’s first end-to-end solution for heavy equipment monitoring. 
 HiberHeavy helps mining, construction, and agriculture companies to use and manage their heavy equipment fleets to optimize their production. 
 HiberHeavy’s solution includes all the hardware and software that a worksite needs to connect its vehicles to a fleet management system at an affordable, subscription-based price. 
 The solution uses Hiber’s technology to track vehicle locations, trips, and idle times, anywhere in the world. 
 “HiberHeavy is unique because it makes heavy equipment management possible in remote areas of the world through an easy subscription-based model,” says Florian Gendrault, Commercial Director at Hiber. 
 “Monitoring in remote areas has generally been too expensive to be a reality, but the SaaS pricing model of HiberHeavy simplifies heavy equipment monitoring and removes risks associated with purchasing new technology.” 
 Companies use HiberHeavy to plan better maintenance schedules, but they can also use it to learn more about how much fuel each vehicle burns while idling. 
 “We’re proud to have developed a solution that helps mining companies reduce their carbon footprint through smarter machine monitoring,” says Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder at Hiber. 
 Hiber controls the infrastructure of HiberHeavy, including the sensors, dashboard, and data connections. 
 Customers have a single point of contact for all of their heavy equipment monitoring needs, and Hiber is responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the hardware and software. 
 Hiber BV, a European satellite and communications start-up, has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand the world’s first global IoT (Internet of Things) satellite network. 
 Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented, “The €26 million funding is a fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector. 
 The European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), the EU’s innovation agency, has awarded Hiber a share of its €278 million Innovation Fund, which will enable the EU to play a prominent role in the global space sector and enhance its autonomy. 
Hiber’s in-house-developed satellite constellation will ensure that it is possible to track and monitor machines and devices for a wide range of IoT solutions in some of the world’s hardest-to-reach places.
 Hiber was founded in 2016 to make IoT easy, especially in areas where there is no affordable cellular or WiFi connection. 
 Hiber’s scaling of the satellite network and innovative IoT solutions will have significant positive impact on some of the biggest issues facing the world today, from eliminating food wastage to reducing the environmental impact of extracting fossil fuels. 
 Hiber revealed Monday the launch of HiberHilo, a subscription-based Internet of Things (IoT) end-to-end solution for oil and gas well integrity monitoring. 
Hiber plans to introduce similar services for other specific use cases in 2021.
This is Hiber’s first news release of 2020.
 Hiber launched an IoT network in 2019, following the launch of their 2 satellites in 2019. 
HiberHilo uses Hiber’s global satellite network to help customers automate continuous annulus pressure and wellhead monitoring of up to 250 wells in a radius of 10 kilometers.
 Coen Janssen, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at Hiber said, “We are excited to launch this first-of-its-kind IoT proposition for remote monitoring at a time when it is needed more than ever. 
HiberHilo has already been proven by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) and Royal Dutch Shell (better known as just “Shell”) on an abandoned on-shore well.
Hiber successfully launches second generation satellite via SpaceX’s Transporter-1
 This European company, Hiber, has successfully launched it’s second generation satellite developed inhouse. 
 The new on-board propulsion system allows Hiber’s ground engineers to adjust the satellite’s orbit, safeguarding against collisions and, enabling de-orbit at the end-of-life, making Hiber one of the most responsible CubeSat constellation operators in the world. 
Hiber Four is a second generation satellite developed and assembled by Hiber’s engineers in its Amsterdam office.
 Hiber Four, and its sister satellite Hiber Three (launching in March), are half the volume (3U) of the previous generation, which reduces the mass and decreases the launch costs by up to 50 percent. 
The newest generation of satellites also have an on-board propulsion system allowing Hiber’s ground engineers to adjust the satellite’s orbit.
 This ensures that Hiber Four, and its future descendants, avoid collisions and, importantly, de-orbit themselves at the end-of-life, making Hiber one of the most responsible CubeSat constellation operators in the world. 
 “This is just the start of what’s coming,” says Maarten Engelen, MD Technology and Co-founder at Hiber. 
 Unlike the previous generation of satellites, which relied on external development and assembly, Hiber Four was developed in-house by Hiber’s satellite team. 
The satellites and Hiber’s end-to-end IoT solutions demonstrate the company’s ability to develop technically complex systems and operate them in the most harsh conditions.
 An example of this technical innovation is Hiber’s most recent product, HiberHilo, a complete end-to-end wellhead pressure and temperature monitoring system for oil and gas companies. 
 By moving development in-house, Hiber is able to develop innovative and secure solutions on demand at a faster and more affordable rate, benefitting both its customers and the industry as a whole. 
 “Hiber Four is the start of a new era at Hiber,” says Erik Wienk, COO, Hiber. 
 “Not only does Hiber Four mean we can give better service levels to our customers, but it also shows what we’re capable of as a team.” 
Hiber Four is the first of two new satellites that Hiber plans to launch this quarter.
 The next satellite, called Hiber Three, will launch in a Soyuz rocket in March 2021. 
Hiber Four was launched before Hiber Three because of a delay of the Soyuz launch vehicle.

Entrepreneur-turned- investor Eros Resmini has invested in Swedish UGC platform Hiber through his VC vehilcle The Mini Fund.
 Resmini, who was a co-founder at Discord, and previously part of the management at mobile gaming network OpenFeint, will also join the Hiber board. 
 Hiber, which operates the eponymous mobile/PC gaming platform raised additional funding from its seed round participants, including Luminar Ventures, Wild Sloths OY, Bumble Ventures, Konvoy Ventures, GFR Fund, and SYBO. 
This takes Hiber’s total funding to-date to $4.5 million.
 “I met the Hiber team in late 2019 and have stayed in touch and followed their progress and execution since,” said Resmini.

Anyone who has had Chinese chili crisp or chili oil will almost undoubtedly become a fan.
 Chili crisp is an infused oil condiment that usually contains crunchy, flavorful bits of peppers, onions or scallions, garlic and other aromatics. 
 “Chili crisp,” “chili oil and “chili sauce” can often be used interchangeably, but generally what differentiates chili crisp is the ratio of crispy bits to oil. 
 “The chili inside stays crispy, and that’s a large part of the condiment,” said Lucas Sin, chef and owner of Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day Chinese Takeout in New York City, adding that the ratio of crisp to oil is such that you get much more crisp than oil in each spoonful, which creates an addictive texture. 
 Lao Gan Ma is the most well-known, mass-produced chili crisp. 
 While Huabi made chili crisp famous, similar infused oil condiments have been used in China for centuries. 
 Lao Gan Ma is the most well-known, mass-produced chili crisp. 
 For example, Sin explained, chili crisps from southern China are often made with spices simmered in oil, leading to “a beautiful, bright red, more rounded mouthfeel to the chili crisp,” whereas chili crisps from northern China are made by pouring hot oil over spices to activate them. 
 Many traditional Chinese chili crisps or oils contain ground Sichuan peppercorns, which seduce those who indulge in it with mala: intense heat and numbing sensations that play off each other for a unique sensory experience. 
There are countless numbers of chili crisps being sold now in the U.S. Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images
 Fly by Jing Sichuan Chili Crisp is an all-natural chili crisp made in Chengdu, China, adds Sichuan peppers, preserved black beans, mushroom powder and sesame oil for enhanced flavor. 
 How to use chili crisp, oil or sauce 
 Chili crisps and oils, while already popular, became even more in-demand during the pandemic, often selling out. 
 Now that even more people have experienced Chinese chili crisp, oil and sauce, it’s bound to become a pantry staple. 
 There are no hard and fast rules for how to use them, though some chefs recommend using crisps as more of a condiment, while oils and sauces can be used in the cooking process. 
 If you’re feeling adventurous, chili crisp is also said to be a great topping for vanilla ice cream, with the sweet and heat working together as a memorable combo. 
How to make your own chili crisp or oil
 With so many options on the market that are lovingly crafted by the pros, making your own chili crisp or oil may not be top of mind — but it could be a good way to get creative. 
Sin shared his tips for creating chili crisp or oil at home:
 Yes, it is possible to make your own chili crisp at home. 
 They are crisp and juicy, laced with ginger and spice. 
Sales of Keogh’s Crisps ‘share bag’ have increased by a third during the pandemic.
 “During the pandemic a lot of people have spent more time consuming luxury foods at home and we would be the biggest player in the premium sharing crisp market,” he said. 
 In contrast, sales of the company’s smaller ‘impulse’ crisp bag, in service stations and coffee shops “has completely disappeared”. 
 Underscoring the increased demand for the farm family owned company’s crisps during the pandemic, Mr Keogh said the company’s production capacity has faced serious tests where some weeks volumes increased by 150 per cent “and we were able to deliver”. 
He said Keogh’s is the largest Irish owned player in the crisp market here with about 10 per cent market share.
 Mr Keogh made his remarks when commenting on new abridged accounts showing that Keogh’s Crisps Ltd recorded pre-Covid profits of €99,491 in the 15 months to the end of March 2020. 
Signing roundup: Preston Crisp headed to SC State; Benedictine and Johnson athletes sign
 Former Woodville-Tompkins basketball standout Preston Crisp took the road less traveled to achieve his goal, signing two years ago to play junior college ball at East Georgia State in Swainsboro. 
   My time at East Georgia was a learning experience,   Crisp said. 
 Crisp, who was the Savannah Morning News Boys Basketball Player of the Year as a senior at Woodville in 2019, averaged 16 points, seven rebounds and two assists for East Georgia this past season. 
 I got a lot stronger and put on some weight (adding close to 25 pounds to reach 200) and became a more versatile player,   Crisp said. 
Woodville coach Lenny Williams said Crisp has what it takes to succeed at the next level.
 NILES — Though he’s a California kid at heart, Northeast Ohio is like a second home to Coco Crisp. 
It’s where Crisp began his career in Major League Baseball.
It’s where he began to build his family — Crisp’s oldest child was born in Cleveland.
 So while Crisp admits that he is already homesick (“Family means everything to me, I’m a very blessed man with a great family,” Crisp says), he also is quick to acknowledge that he feels right at home in Niles. 
Earlier this week Crisp arrived at what will be his 2021 summer home — Eastwood Field.
 Last month, Crisp was named manager of the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. 
 “I have nothing but great memories of my time in Northeast Ohio,” Crisp said. 
 Crisp played for the Cleveland Indians from 2002-05, then again in 2016. 
 In between those two stints with the Tribe, Crisp played with Boston (2006-08), Kansas City (2009) and Oakland (2010-16). 
 As a youth, Crisp’s introduction into athletics came by way of boxing and karate — sports he learned from his father. 
 “It was pretty cool, when you’re a kid and you find something that you’re good at, you tend to stick with it,” Crisp said. 
Success followed at the high school level and at Los Angeles Pierce College before Crisp was selected in the seventh round of the 1999 MLB Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals.
 “At each level, I just tried to be the best I could be, I was never looking ahead,” Crisp said. 
 Ironically, Crisp’s coaching career has taken a very similar path. 
At the end of the 2016 season a number of teams reached out to Crisp seeking his services.
Crisp immediately began coaching his son’s Little League team.
 “Coaching was never a goal, it just happened,” Crisp said. 
 Crisp believes that managing this summer in a three-month long MLB Draft League is “the perfect introduction for the next step,” of his coaching career. 
 “I’m really a very simple person so being away from my family will be my biggest challenge this summer,” Crisp said. 
 Still, Crisp said that fans should expect to see a very competitive Scrappers team this summer. 
 “I’m going to let these kids loose, I’m going to take off the shackles and give them the green light,” Crisp said. 
This stylish casserole was left at the writer’s house years ago by friends who brought over an apple crisp dessert.
 It was wonderful, an apple crisp, full of flavor with a satisfying crust. 
 Months later, there was an article in our paper about making crisps. 
 The inside of the crisp was pretty general: Coat the bottom and sides of the baking dish with a bit of butter and add fruit, peeled and cut up into uniform pieces, tossed with a couple of tablespoons of flour, a tablespoon of sugar, and spice if you like it. 
Pat the crisp mixture onto the top of the fruit mix

 In the latest twist in this long-running saga, the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina has found the term PRETZEL CRISPS to be generic for pretzel crackers. 
The court therefore upheld the decision of the TTAB [here] ordering cancellation of the PRETZEL CRISPS Supplemental Registration.
 The court observed that there was no dispute that the product was   hugely successful, due in no small part to Plaintiffs' extensive marketing efforts and the PRETZEL CRISPS trademark registration they received and have enforced to clear the field of similarly named products. 
 Judge Kenneth Bell first considered whether the combination of the generic terms   pretzel   and   crisps   creates any additional meaning for consumers from which they can distinguish Plaintiff's product.   
 He concluded that it did not, and therefore that PRETZEL CRISPS is generic. 
 Summarizing the evidence on the genericness of the mark, considered as a whole, the Court finds that the combination of the acknowledged generic elements of the compound mark   yields no additional meaning to consumers capable of distinguishing the goods   and, independently, usage by competitors, media references and consumer surveys (as well as some use by Plaintiffs) reflects that, on balance, consumers primarily perceive   pretzel crisps   to be a common/generic name.

Apps like Polarsteps make it easy to keep track of your entire trip.
 Add photos, text, and points of interest and Polarsteps will do the rest. 
This is exactly what Polarsteps makes possible.
 If you are starting with Polarsteps, please add your Polarsteps trip before starting your trip via the Travel tab. 
 Once you hit the road, Polarsteps will start tracking your ride. 
Polarsteps then asks you to fill in a so-called “step” every time you open the app.
 If you travel regularly and use Polarsteps, you can see exactly which routes you’ve traveled and where you come from most often. 
 You can do this by viewing all the steps of your journey, but you can also create a picture book from Polarsteps. 
Polarsteps picture book is the only revenue model for the app developed in the Netherlands – the app is free and the developers do not intend to fill the app with ads.
Polarsteps can be downloaded for free from the file Google Play Store On Apple App Store.
What do you think of the concept of Polarsteps?
 Polarsteps just raised a seed round to continue developing its automated travel blogging app, to make the jealousy-machine run just that tiny bit smoother. 
 Polarsteps is optimized for travel, which means that you don’t need data roaming or cell coverage to let the app do its thing: GPS works independently of mobile reception and the app synchronizes its data whenever you hit a pocket of cell reception — or when you log in to the Wi-Fi at the hotel at the end of a long, dusty day of travel. 
He clarifies that the Beta label reflects that the app currently has a limited feature-set and that it signals that Polarsteps is under active development.
 The implementation of Polarsteps is very well done, but the idea itself is not particularly original: there have been a slew of companies and solutions in this space over the years. 
 In particular, the Polarsteps solution has more than a few things in common with esplorio. 
 The idea for Polarsteps came to Niek Bokkers, one of the company’s founders, when he set out to sea on a sailing peregrination back in 2013. 
 In addition to locations and photos, Polarsteps tracks a ton of other data, including distance traveled, countries visited and more. 
Amsterdam-based travel startup Polarsteps allows travelers to share their trips in real time with their closest friends and family.
 The round was led by INKEF Capital, brings Polarsteps’ total funding to date to €4.6 million, after previously raising a €900k seed round in 2017. 
 Polarsteps makes money by letting users buy their special “Travel Books”, which are instant photo albums of trips that can be ordered at the push of a button. 
Polarsteps’ one million registered users have collectively traveled over 52 million days on the app – shown on a heat map that the company published today.
 Polarsteps co-founder and CEO Koen Droste said: “Being avid travelers ourselves, we founded Polarsteps because we want to inspire and connect people through travel. 
 In the coming year, Polarsteps will become the place to go to for planning, tracking and remembering all your trips.” 
 Kyang Yung, Investment Director at INKEF, commented: “The two things that stood out to us about Polarsteps were the virality of the product and a company business model that is global from the get-go. 
 The Polarsteps team has the potential to create something truly disruptive in the travel space, and we’re excited to join them on their journey.” 
Over 2.5 million explorers have chosen Polarsteps to create and capture their adventures.
WHAT THE PRESS ARE SAYING ABOUT POLARSTEPS
   The Polarsteps app replaces your travel journal, making it easier and more beautiful.   
   Polarsteps helps you track and share your journeys in an easy and visually appealing way.   
   Polarsteps' resulting travel log is impressive, and is the source of a severe case of itchy feet in your correspondent.   
We'd love to hear what you think about Polarsteps.
 Speaking with Koen Droste, CEO of travel-logging app Polarsteps, he shared that what people will need most is: inspiration, reliable information, and flexibility. 
 To help fuel this creative travel energy, Polarsteps recently released a new feature where users can plan their future trips and itineraries. 
 The other day on Polarsteps we saw a user who was visiting all the places on the Dutch Monopoly board in order,” Droste told TNW. 
 To help solve these problems for their users, Polarsteps wants to create an all-in-one travel platform where travelers can find reliable and high-quality travel information. 
Anyone interested in donating can go to wellstrong.org/wellstrong-recovery-ride and can follow along on O’Reilly’s journey at polarsteps.com.
 Once you find cell service and/or an internet connection, Polarsteps syncs up your route, your stops along the way and then geotags your photos, organizing them all on a vivid, shareable map. 
 Inkef Capital recently invested in fellow Dutch travel startup PolarSteps, an app that allows travelers to log their trips in real time and share the results with friends and family. 
Polarsteps – Travel Tracker We travel for the story and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of where a photo was taken or memory was made.
 Polarsteps documents with geotagging on a map with photos you take that can be shared through your social media or a private link to friends, family and anyone else you want to make jealous that they aren’t on this trip with you. 
 >>Polarsteps, a trip-tracking app, has raised $3.4 million (€3 million) in Series A funding. 
Users of the Polarsteps app can agree to have it automatically track their trip.
 Polarsteps – Imagine having someone following you on your travels, and uploading your notes and pictures on a webpage so your friends and family can follow along. 
 Beyond having a single platform to house the “entire travel experience”, Polarsteps is a huge source of inspiration for your next travels. 
 If you have ever been in a spot where you chanced upon a new location and could not recall how to go there again, Polarsteps is the right app for you. 
 Keeping track of your travel route and places you visit, Polarsteps creates an automatic travel journal for you. 
 Portfolio includes: travel app Polarsteps, fashion marketplace The Next Closet and retail tech provider Swogo. 
 There are other more specialized apps, like Polarsteps, that help you take a closer look at the exact trajectory of your trips. 
 Polarsteps is good for tracking any trip on your mobile device, but if you use it for keeping tabs on the states you’ve visited, you’ll know exactly which ones you set foot in during a particular trip. 
 Travel apps, on the other hand like TraveLibro still need catching up from Indian players, at the moment Polarsteps, and Journi, which are travel-based apps based out of the EU are what TraveLibro considers as competition. 
With Polarsteps the impromptu becomes the imprinted.
 Zivver, an Amsterdam-based challenger business in secure communications, has raised $17 million in new funding, bringing its total funding to date to over $30 million.

Otrium has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its $26 million Series B round.
The concept behind Otrium is quite simple.
 When items reach the end-of-season status, brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them. 
Otrium is currently available in Europe.
 With Otrium, brands can add another sales channel for those specific items. 
 And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items, Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies. 
The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.
Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time.
 With today’s funding round, Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Joseph, Anine Bing, Belstaff, Reiss and ASICS. 
 Dutch end-of-season fashion online marketplace Otrium has bagged US$120 million in its Series C financing round, which will go towards its upcoming U.S. launch and improving its technology platform. 
 Otrium, the Amsterdam-headquartered online fashion “outlet” selling unsold end-of-season items, has raised US$120 million in a Series C round co-led by tech venture capital BOND and London-San Francisco investment firm Index Ventures. 
Otrium added that the Series C funds will support hiring and the growth of its team.
 Founded by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra in 2015, Otrium, which currently operates in Europe, enables clothing brand partners to sell their off-season inventory in order to avoid unsold fashion items from ending up in the landfills – or in many cases, especially for luxury labels, destroyed or burned in the name of brand exclusivity. 
 Milan Daniels, Co-Founder & CEO, Otrium 
 Particularly amid the pandemic, Otrium says that its digital business model, which embeds both convenience and sustainability, has flourished, with its revenues having tripled over 2020 despite the broader economic downturn for high street and brick-and-mortar players. 
Otrium sells unsold inventory from partner brands.
 With the fresh capital, Otrium says its analytics functionality can undergo further improvement to help fashion houses figure out past demand trends and future insights, a shift that the firm and its investors believe will shape producers’ strategies and ultimately boost revenues while making a dent on the enormous 92 million tonnes of waste the industry still produces annually. 
Otrium’s digital approach has been one that many sustainable fashion players believe will be critical to push forward circularity in the industry.
 With Otrium, every fashion label can begin to build their iconic portfolio.” 
 Retailers are in dire need of sustainable ways to offload and even profit from their excess stock, which is where online fashion marketplace Otrium provides an answer, offering an inventory overflow solution that doesn't end in clothing combustion. 
 On the membership side, Otrium prioritizes consumer expectations for excellent service by offering next-day delivery, simplified returns and buyer protection to streamline secure purchasing. 
 Otrium is a case study that PSFK analysts noted in research on innovative solutions and strategies for 2020's majorly disrupted and quickly transforming fashion industry—for more, see here. 
 Otrium has raised a $26 million Series B funding round (€24 million), with Eight Roads Ventures leading the round. 
Otrium works with clothing brands to help them sell items when they reach the end-of-season status.
 Otrium wants to add another sales channel for those specific items — and it’s an online one, which should help when it comes to shelf space. 
That’s why Otrium has created a marketplace and tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion brands.
 If you decide to sell end-of-season collections on Otrium, you can manage your own outlet, get in-depth analytics and enable a dynamic pricing engine to maximize revenue on those outdated items. 
 Two hundred brands have decided to partner with Otrium, such as Joseph, Reiss, G-Star, Asics, Puma, Vans, Pepe Jeans, Alexachung and Scotch & Soda. 
There are one million registered customers on Otrium.
 Dutch app Otrium, which sells unsold stocks of branded clothing, has raised 100 million euros in fresh capital to prepare its planned expansion to the United States. 
 Otrium was founded in 2015 by two Dutch entrepreneurs, Max Klijnstra and Milan Daniels, and has grown at lightning speed since then. 
 At previous investment rounds, Otrium had already raised 7 million euros (2019) and 24 million (2020). 
 Before creating Otrium, Klijnstra and Daniels already were active in the fashion industry: they sold jumpers with striking prints through Breaking Rocks. 
LONDON — The fashion industry’s inventory problem has only gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic and the online designer outlet Otrium — which just got a big cash boost — believes it can help.
 Otrium has already been pushing into key European markets, with a dedicated U.K. site making its debut this week. 
 Otrium pitches itself as a tech-enabled, digital solution to make end-of-season selling easier for brands of all sizes. 
 The platform sets pricing for products based on variables such as style, number of units and sizes available, and interest from Otrium’s wider community. 
 As a result, Otrium chose to operate in “a similar way to a physical outlet but digitized,” making it more accessible to smaller-scale labels that are unable to face the cost — and commitments — attached to physical retail on the platform. 
 Once on board, Otrium wants to “share data and convince brands to start making decisions on the basis of data rather than on the basis of trend forecasting.” 
 Otrium, an online fashion marketplace, which sells brands' remaining end-of-season merchandise, on Wednesday announced that it raised €24 million ($26.6 million as of press time) in a Series B funding round, led by Eight Roads Ventures with additional contributions from existing investors Index Ventures and Hans Veldhuizen. 
Otrium will use the funding to grow internationally.
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Otrium has received   doubling of interest from brands   and has experienced a 40% spike in revenue during the past month, according to the company press release. 
 Based on Otrium's release, the retailer appears to be positioning itself as a possible solution for offloading the unsold merchandise due to the pandemic. 
   We are focused on onboarding an unprecedented pipeline of brands and we're working on generating revenue for items that would otherwise go unsold,   Otrium​ CEO and co-founder Milan Daniels said in a statement. 
 Earlier this year, Vestiaire Collective received a $216 million investment from Kering and Tiger Global; Dutch online outlet Otrium raised $29 million in the summer of 2020, followed by an additional $120 million last March to fuel U.S. expansion. 
 New York – Amsterdam-based online fashion marketplace Otrium has recently secured a 24 million euro Series B financing round led by investors with stakes in other fashion companies such as Alibaba, Farfetch and ASOS. 
 Otrium helps global and independent clothing brands sell end-of-season collections that would otherwise go unsold, as the company states on its website. 
 Otrium’s fashion marketplace gives retailers full control over price, while they can leverage an array of advanced analytics and insights into dynamic pricing, excess inventory and merchandising. 
 In 2015 they launched Otrium, an online marketplace for end-of-season clothes that allows brands to sell their unsold inventory at cheaper prices. 
 This is where Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra think they have found a niche in the market with their company Otrium, which raised a €7m Series-A round led by venture capital firm Index Ventures on Thursday. 
 In true entrepreneur style, the problem led them to found a company, Otrium, to test out a different approach. 
 “Otrium tries to replicate an outlet store, but online,” says Daniels. 
 Otrium, which is based in the Netherlands, takes a cut of each sale made on their platform. 
 So far Otrium has managed to convince some 100 brands, including names like G-Star, Puma, Vans, Pepe Jeans and Scotch & Soda, to try the approach. 
 The money will be used to expand Otrium’s presence across Europe starting with Germany, the UK and France, says Daniels. 
 Otrium, an Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based online fashion outlet, raised €7m in Series A funding. 
 In conjunction with the funding, Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, joined Otrium’s board. 
 Founded in 2016 by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra, Otrium has developed its own model for selling excess inventory. 
Many brands have been using brick-and-mortar discount outlets or online marketplaces like the Dutch start-up Otrium to try to shift the designer clothes piling up in warehouses.
 Resale platforms have had no trouble tapping investors, with Vestiaire Collective raising €59 million at the height of the lockdown in April and Rebag raising $15 million in May. Then there’s Otrium, an Amsterdam-based company that promises to help brands sell excess inventory, which raised $26.4 million in May. 
 Some, including Otrium, could even thrive as fashion reels from store closures and weak consumer spending. 
 “The ability to thrive in this new environment is important to me as an investor,” said Davor Hebel, a managing partner at Eight Roads Ventures, which led Otrium’s latest round of funding. 
 Otrium, which lets brands like Scotch & Soda, Reiss, Esprit and Guess sell off their end-of-season product on its platform, fits Hebel’s criteria. 
 Online fashion hub Otrium does just this, selling end-of-season collections from retail brands that would otherwise have to destroy their inventory by letting them manage their own outlet, set prices and even access consumer insights. 
 In 2020, Eight Roads Ventures Europe invested in Cazoo, Otrium, Spendesk, Odaseva and most recently Tibber, completed eight follow-on investments and exited Rimilia. 
5) Fashion marketplace Otrium nabs $120 million
 Amsterdam-based unsold fashion marketplace Otrium has raised $120 million in a fresh round of funding co-led by BOND and Index Ventures, and saw follow-on investment from Eight Roads Ventures. 
 The series C round is expected to propel Otrium’s entry to the US market, ramp up additional unsold fashion capabilities, and recruit new staff. 
Thrilled to double down on our partnership with @OtriumOfficial and co-lead their $120M Series C with BOND!
 As expected, several notable companies have made it to the list, which includes companies such as 3D Hubs, MessageBird, Otrium, Picnic, Recruitee, The Next Ad and Zivver. 
 “Fashion brands struggle with an abundance of excess inventory collecting dust in a warehouse,” explains Otrium’s cofounder Milan Daniels, 26. 
 Launched two years ago by Daniels and Max Klijnstra, 27, Otrium is effectively Shopify for fashion brands, providing the e-commerce technology stack and logistics handling to create online outlet/clearance stores. 
 Claiming 300,000 users and 60 brands across Benelux countries, Otrium recently raised €750,000 (£662,000) – bringing total funding to €1.6 million (£1.4 million) – to fuel international expansion. 
 Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack now compete with resale platforms such as The RealReal and Poshmark and newer ventures like Otrium and Madaluxe Vault — which Freede launched in recent years to sell excess designer items to consumers directly — that put their own spin on the off-price model. 
 Otrium, a five-year-old company based in Amsterdam, operates a marketplace where brands can sell their surplus directly to consumers, which it says offers higher margins than the wholesale market. 
Otrium co-founder Milan Daniels told BoF his company offers prices to sellers that are three times as much as other stock buyers.
 One of Gapstars clients is Otrium, a fast-growing tech company and a fashion e-commerce platform that enables the World’s leading fashion brands to find buyers for clothing unsold at stores. 
 Otrium has secured over $30 million in funding, including $24 million Series B funding in mid-2020 at the height of the global pandemic. 
Otrium will use the funding to grow internationally.

 NEW YORK – Agendia has amassed tumor samples, as well as genomic and clinical data, from 6,000 breast cancer patients it has tested within the FLEX Registry, a resource that the molecular diagnostics firm is hoping will be a rich resource for studying groups that have been historically underrepresented in research. 
 All the enrolled patients have consented to sharing their tumor samples and clinical information, which are linked to results from Agendia's MammaPrint and BluePrint tests, and full transcriptome analysis, as well as 10 years of follow-up data. 
 As a requirement for enrollment into FLEX, patients must have their breast cancers tested with Agendia's MammaPrint and BluePrint tests. 
 According to William Audeh, Agendia's chief medical officer, this was one of the driving factors behind launching the FLEX Registry, within which Agendia also performs transcriptomic analysis on patients' tumor samples and links it to more than 800 clinical data points. 
 NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CarePayment, a patient financing company that partners with providers to make healthcare affordable through 0.00% APR payment plans, has had a significant year of growth, despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the healthcare industry. 
 2019 was a record year for CarePayment, reaching the status as the largest patient financing vendor in the industry. 
 “Throughout the pandemic, health systems have suffered unprecedented losses while many patients have delayed important medical care due to financial insecurity,” said CarePayment CEO Craig Hodges. 
 To support the increase in providers and patients served, CarePayment redesigned its website for a better user experience and launched the Advanced Patient Engagement Platform which includes capabilities for early digital patient engagement messaging (as early as registration/scheduling), digital-first enrollment, text-to-pay functionality, all integrated with high-touch human support and an intelligent account servicing workflow that engages more patients by eliminating needless barriers to service. 
These new capabilities will expand CarePayment’s ability to engage more patients and provide a critical service to providers.

 CarePayment will work with Acoustic Campaign to drive highly targeted, intelligence-based outreach to improve engagement and payment. 
 “The CarePayment team has remained focused on providing innovative, best-in-class programs, solutions, and customer service to both providers and patients, despite the strain that the pandemic placed on the healthcare industry,” said Ed Caldwell, Chief Revenue Officer at CarePayment. 
CarePayment is a patient financing company that accelerates a healthcare providers' transition to the new consumer-driven healthcare market.
 By partnering with healthcare providers to make affordable financial options available, CarePayment helps patients get the care they need, when they need it, while protecting the financial health of provider organizations so they can continue to offer valuable care to the community. 
 CarePayment's patient-friendly financing is compliant with applicable state and federal consumer credit laws, requires no application, and is supported by a friendly US-based customer service staff.

CarePay chief executive Kees van Lede said more Kenyans would be able to access quality healthcare that would promptly be paid for.
 Mr. Manderson said he expected to receive details of the CarePay contract audit by the end of this month, once government entities involved in the review had an opportunity to review the report. 
 The testimony at trial included statements indicating there was “little scrutiny” given to the five-year, US$13 million contract for the CarePay swipe-card system for public hospital patients. 
 A US$2.4 million expense for the proposed expansion of the CarePay card system to private sector insurers and healthcare providers was inserted into government’s 2011/12 budget, but no contract for the purported agreement ever existed. 
 It was also revealed that Watson, as HSA chairman, was put “in charge” of the CarePay project implementation, involving complex computer programming tasks for which he had no specific knowledge or training to assess. 
 During the trial, Crown prosecutors alleged that Watson rushed through the original CarePay contract process and later bamboozled civil servants – and possibly a government minister – into approving funds for the system expansion, even though no contract existed for it. 
 NAIROBI, Kenya, Feb 18 -CarePay Kenya and Ajua have released a report on Mobile Health Transformation in Kenya.

CarePay has received a KES 150 million grant from Agence Française de Développement (AFD) to further build the functionality and reach of the M-TIBA platform.
 Kees van Lede, Chief Executive Officer, CarePay Ltd said, “This partnership will help CarePay improve the M-TIBA platform’s capability and reach. 
CarePay is focused on making healthcare more accessible to all.
 AFD’s country Director, Mr Ghislain de Valon, said, “Beyond the financing itself, AFD and CarePay wish to build a partnership whose objective would be to capitalize on the key challenges for the Universal Health Coverage and possible digital solutions, with the idea of working to disseminate the lessons learned from this experiment: the first CarePay extension pilots in Nigeria and Tanzania show in particular the structure’s ability to adapt to situations where mobile currency has not yet developed.” 
 Cayman Islands businessman Canover Watson was ordered Thursday to pay the government US$1.12 million (CI$925,995.58) over his role in the CarePay hospital swipe-card fraud, for which he was sentenced to seven years in prison. 
 Mr. Webb was jointly charged, along with Mr. Watson, in connection with the CarePay fraud. 
Justice Carter said the confiscation order against Mr. Watson “does not satisfy any other confiscation order in relation to the same joint benefit” – meaning the US$6.8 million benefit the Crown identified from the CarePay fraud.
 The claims adjudication service was never fully implemented, and proposals aimed at putting private sector insurance customers onto the CarePay system never came to fruition.

5.9.3 Connecterra's (Netherlands) AI-Based Solution Improving Farm Productivity in Individual Farm in US
Don’t call Connecterra a Fitbit for cows.
 Connecterra just raised €4.2 million, which seemed like a good reason to sit down with its CEO, Yasir Kokhar, for a fascinating deep dive into the overlap between AI and agtech. 
SPRING VALLEY – One Wisconsin herdsman who began using Connecterra’s integrated herd management system called Ida – for Intelligent Dairy Assistant – has seen a lot of improvements in how he manages the dairy herd he works with.
 Mitchell knew Julie Larson, (see main story) who is the U.S. Regional Sales Director for Connecterra. 
When he visited with Larson he learned of her new position with Connecterra.
 Dutch innovation company Connecterra has developed an “intelligent cow-monitoring system” that follows individual cows’ every move, relaying live information back to the farmer. 
Connecterra claims it’s Big Bovine Brother network can tell if a cow gets sick 24 to 48 hours before any visual symptoms arise by analyzing changes in internal temperature (that aren’t accounted for by external factors like high outside temperatures and humidity levels).
 “For a typical Dutch farm, which are generally known to be very productive to begin with, we’ve seen about a 20 percent to 30 percent gain in efficiency in farm operations using Connecterra,” Yasir Khokhar, former Microsoft employee, and the company’s CEO. 
 Just to get your herd all hooked up with Connecterra, it costs a substantial $79.99-per-cow, and $3-per-month charge per cow. 
 But there is, of course, a downside: if farmers continue to use technologies like Connecterra’s in the future, will their intuition change or vanish over time?

 The company's project-based approach can be seen in partnership it operates with Connecterra, a Dutch start-up developing an artificial intelligence for dairy farmers. 
 Connecterra is also part of Danone's 3-year project Farming for Generations, launched in 2019. 
Background: Connecterra has created an artificial intelligence (AI) that helps dairy producers monitor the health and well-being of their herds.
 “IDA uses deep learning and complex algorithms to process the data, which is then presented back to the producer as easy-to-understand, actionable insights in an app,” says Khokhar, Connecterra cofounder and CEO.

 Bovine technology typically has come in the form of “glorified pedometers”, according to Yasir Khokhar, the founder and chief executive of Dutch software start-up Connecterra. 
 He founded Connecterra, after observing a need for more efficient technology for farmers stuck with “highly outdated systems”. 
 Ida is created by a Dutch company Connecterra, which is using TensorFlow, Google's AI software. 
Connecterra is trying to use TensorFlow to address global hunger through AI-enabled efficient farming and sustainable food development.
 Applied this way, AI can only improve the productivity of specific resource-intensive dairy farms and is unlikely to meet Connecterra’s goal of ending world hunger.

 “Great examples of startups in our space that are well on their way to doing that are Connecterra, who are on a mission to make global agriculture more productive and sustainable using sensors and artificial intelligence, and No Isolation, who builds robots designed to reduce social isolation in vulnerable groups in society,” Nijssen added. 
 For example, Senseye helps manufacturers prevent machine downtime through predictive analytics, FoodMarble has produced a smart device that can help people with digestive problems and Connecterra has developed a wearable device for cows that improves the productivity of the herd. 
 For example, Connecterra, an Amsterdam-based startup, uses Google AI to create digital sensors that farmers can use to monitor their livestock’s movement and eating habits. 
 Connecterra actually pays Microsoft to rent cloud storage, the main way Google hopes to cash in on its AI tools. 
 The Alpha award, for those with less than $500,000 in funding, was won by Connecterra, a company that provides location and monitoring services for dairy cattle.

 Only 22% of EV drivers say there are always enough charging stations where they work, and 43% say there are no chargers at all, according to a report from market research firm Ipsos and EVBox Group, a global provider of EV charging solutions. 
 They will also have the opportunity to make a huge impact on their employees, society, and the planet, according to findings of the EVBox Mobility Monitor, which surveyed over 2,000 U.S. residents nationwide in February 2021. 
 Daimler’s commercial vehicle division has also entered into its own collaborations with Engie, EVBox, Siemens Smart Infrastructure for EV infrastructure and Shell for fuel cell truck infrastructure. 
 For the charging infrastructure of battery-electric trucks, the German truck-maker plans to work with Engie, EVBox and Siemens Smart Infrastructure. 
 The top two based on market share are North American leader ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) and leading European provider EVBox, which will soon go public through a merger with SPAC TPG Pace Beneficial Finance (NYSE: TPGY). 
Company 2021 Revenue Estimate (millions) 2020 Revenue (millions) ChargePoint $200 $146 EVBox $145 $84 Volta $47 $25 EVgo $20 $14 Blink Charging NP* $6.2
Both ChargePoint and EVBox have more established and diversified networks.
 EVBox has sold more than 235,000 charge ports, the most of any company. 
The business combination bringing EVBox public is expected to close in June 2021.
 Based on the valuation initially presented when the merger was announced, EVBox would have a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion at the current share price. 
 That makes EVBox clearly cheaper on a price-to-sales basis, as ChargePoint's market cap is approximately $6.5 billion. 
The most concerning news is that the TPGY/EVBox SPAC deal may fall apart.
Potentially the biggest SPAC news today is that the TPG Pace Beneficial (TPGY) / EVBox merger may be falling apart.
It plunged -12.5% following an 8-K that called doubt as to whether their deal with EVBox will ultimately be completed.
 Adding more fast charging stations on the nation’s roads would bring down these barriers and accelerate EV adoption in the United States, according to a report from market research firm Ipsos and EVBox Group, a global provider of EV charging stations. 
 Other notable findings about fast charging from the EVBox Mobility Monitor, based on a survey of more than 2,000 U.S. residents nationwide in February 2021: 
 Previous research conducted in Europe by EVBox and Ipsos has shown that when drivers know more about how EVs work, they are more likely to buy them. 
 EVBox Group, based in Libertyville, Ill., works with Ipsos annually to assess EV adoption in Europe. 
TPGY Stock: Why TPG Pace Beneficial Is Stumbling Today Ahead of Its EVBox Merger
 “In order to be able to assist our customers with all manner of questions concerning planning, application and implementation processes concerning charging infrastructure, as well as with connection to the electrical network, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE and EVBox Group,” continues Wallfeld. 
 If the customer makes use of the services provided by Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE or EVBox Group, these partners will look after the analysis of the depots and the establishment of suitable infrastructure and energy supply, together with intelligent hardware and software-based charging solutions. 
 Siemens Smart Infrastructure, ENGIE and EVBox Group collaborate closely with Mercedes-Benz Trucks in all phases of the process. 
TPGY and EVBox haven’t set a firm date for their merger closure.
EVBox also gave TPGY the right to terminate the agreement at any time during the 15 business days following the date on which EVBox delivers the audited financial statements for 2020 to TPGY.
 CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday broke down three companies that fell into the charging-station category, concluding that the one investors should be most interested in is EVBox. 
Netherlands-based EVBox's deal with the SPAC is expected to close late in the first quarter of this year.
   If you want a charging station play, EVBox seems like the best of the bunch — very similar to ChargePoint but with a faster growth and a cheaper stock,   Cramer said Monday. 
 Both EVBox and California-based ChargePoint sell hardware and offer a software-as-a-service component, Cramer said, helping other entities build charging stations at their parking spaces. 
 One of the biggest differences between the companies is that EVBox started in Europe, where it's the market leader, before expanding in the U.S., Cramer said. 
 For the current year, ChargePoint projects revenue growth of about 50% compared with 2020 figures, while EVBox is forecasting sales to increase by about 72%, according to Cramer. 
 Cramer said Los Angeles-based EVgo is   higher risk, higher reward   for investors because it's earlier in its life cycle than EVBox and ChargePoint. 
 It is taking EVBox, a Dutch maker of charging stations, to the NYSE next month. 
 On the close of the deal, EVBox will trade under the symbol EVB. 
 Second, EVBox is more than hardware. 
 This means EVBox has multiple revenue streams – hardware, software, and services. 
 The deal, first announced in December, will deliver $425 million to EVBox, implying a value of $969 million. 
 If I were to pick between ChargePoint and EVBox, I go with EVBox, because the software and services mean continuing revenue.

 LIBERTYVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Despite a global pandemic, EVBox has reached another milestone of its base of installed charge ports. 
 At the end of last year, EVBox Group announced plans to become a public company via a business combination with TPG Pace Beneficial Finance (NYSE: TPGY), and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by late Q1 2021. 
The EVBox Mobility Monitor—a piece of market research conducted with Ipsos—shows that European citizens and future EV drivers share this opinion and take environmental matters seriously.
 In 2020, EVBox celebrated its 10th anniversary and fortified its position as an industry leader not only by reaching the milestone of 200,000 globally installed charge ports but by establishing initiatives to prepare all of EVBox Group for a strong 2021 as a public company. 
 With the interests of EV drivers always in mind, EVBox Group has:

— Electrical services and energy provider Aetna Corp. and electric vehicle (EV) charging company EVBox Group are partnering to help grow EV charging infrastructure in convenience stores and other retail outlets.
 “There has never been a better time for businesses to invest in EV charging, and we are pleased we can now offer EVBox charging solutions to our customers. 
 While Aetna has been offering EV charging services since 2017, it is adding EVBox Group to its offerings because all EVBox products are Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) compliant. 
 By prioritizing charging solutions with open standards, they are also giving business owners the confidence they need to meet the nation’s rising demand for accessible and readily available EV charging,” said Kristof Vereenooghe, CEO of EVBox Group. 
 Founded in 2010 and based in Amsterdam, EVBox Group provides EV charging products. 
 What Happened: On Monday night, TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp (NYSE: TPGY) reported in an 8-K filing that its SPAC merger with EVBox could be at risk. 
 EVBox needs to refile its financial statements for fiscal 2020, according to the filing. 
If TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp moves on from EVBox it could have limited time to get a new deal done and will need to extend its timeline.
The hub will become part of Franklin’s LiFe Network and use chargers by EVBox.
The chargers will be supplied by EVBox and installed over several phases.
– which operates as EVBox – for a combination of cash and equity.
 This development is expected to provide EVBox with significant growth capital to expand its reach globally, with a focus on Europe and North America, and to broaden its technology portfolio. 
 LIBERTYVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following the news that it will become a public company by the end of March via a business combination with TPG Pace Beneficial Finance (NYSE: TPGY), EVBox, a global provider of electric vehicle charging hardware, software and service is taking an important step in its development by becoming ISO-certified. 
 EVBox, the charging station brand of EVBox, has successfully passed an ISO audit to receive the ISO 9001:2015 (quality management systems), ISO 14001:2015 (environmental management systems), and ISO 45001:2018 (occupational health and safety management systems) certifications. 
 Everon, the cloud software platform brand of EVBox offering charging management solutions, has also received the ISO 45001:2018 certification. 
 EVBox underwent a 12-month verification process to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customers’ needs, as well as specific statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The process also verified EVBox’s environmental performance and occupational health and safety management systems.
 This audit represents EVBox’s commitment to always achieving the highest level of quality and service and treating customers, partners, employees, stakeholders and the environment with the highest level of respect as they seek to improve and expand access to EV charging at a global level. 
The certifications are granted by the third-party accredited registrar and certification body BSI and are publicly available in the BSI Certificate and Client Directory and on EVBox’s website.

Amsterdam-based CodeSandbox has raised $12.7 million to help teams collaborate on the development of web-based applications.
 “We want to expand our use cases for CodeSandbox,” CEO and cofounder Ives van Hoorne said. 
CodeSandbox is part of a broader move to simplify coding and make it more accessible — commonly referred to as “low code” or “no code.”
 It’s a big trend, which means CodeSandbox will also face some tough competitors, like Airtable, which recently raised $185 million at a $2.585 billion valuation. 
 Founded by van Horne and Bas Buursma in 2017, CodeSandbox bridges the collaboration and low-code elements by creating a browser-based service. 
 While there are web-based tools for individual coders, CodeSandbox is expanding this idea by making projects available to teams. 
CodeSandbox says its more than 2.5 million monthly users have together created over 10 million projects on the platform.
 While CodeSandbox has so far focused on collaboration, the upcoming Pro Workspaces product will introduce features that make projects accessible to non-developers. 
 The data being crunched highlighted CodeSandbox’s early seed investment, as well as factors like its rapidly growing user base, prompting partners to reach out to the company before it was looking to raise money. 
 In talking with EQT, van Hoorne said he was surprised how much the firm’s partners seemed to know about CodeSandbox’s business. 
 “We were happy to see the fruits from our data-driven proactive approach with CodeSandbox,” EQT analytics partner Henrik Landgren said. 
 Motherbrain also helped us to find and compare the various other related companies, which made us even more excited about CodeSandbox.” 
 CodeSandbox, a Dutch startup that enables developers to create a web app development sandbox in the browser, has officially launched a collaborative platform that allows teams to collaborate on code in the cloud. 
 Up until now, CodeSandbox was mainly focused on individual users, with developers often using CodeSandbox in their own time and then attempting to use it with team members at work. 
A key selling point of CodeSandbox is that it is cloud native — the company hasn’t just transported a local development environment and stuck it on the cloud.
 This “web-first” approach means CodeSandbox is “faster, more collaborative, and easier to use,” CEO Ives van Hoorne said in a press release announcing the launch. 
 The fact that everyone in a product team can use CodeSandbox means developers can comment on each other’s code, designers can pitch in with feedback on the UI, and marketers can review the copy. 
 From the get-go, CodeSandbox has been vocal about its plans to support teams. 
 Before Team Pro, the platform did actually offer a workspace feature so its customers could use CodeSandbox in groups — but this was intended only for public sandboxes, which effectively meant open source software. 
There are some clear synergies between Figma and CodeSandbox in terms of how they enable app prototyping in the browser.
 In fact, Figma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field is an investor in CodeSandbox. 
 Founded out of Amsterdam in 2017, CodeSandbox has raised around $15 million in funding, including a $12.7 million series A round just a few months ago from Kleiner Perkins and other investors. 
It’s free to use CodeSandbox although there are a few minor limitations.
 If I tie my CodeSandbox account to GitHub, for example, all of my code will be public. 
 In fact, CodeSandbox is built on Visual Code and includes code auto-complete suggestions: 
This lets you collaborate with everyone running CodeSandbox in their own browser.
Using CodeSandbox it was easy to complete the assignment right in my Chromebook browser.
Plus I was able to share a link to my CodeSandbox with the prof so he could review and grade it.
 Xcode Cloud follows a notable trend of developer tools gravitating toward the cloud, with GitHub last year bringing its IDE to the browser via Codespaces and countless other tools — such as GitPod, CodeSandbox, Replit, and CoScreen — going to market and raising sizable investments for cloud developer tools over the past few years.

 In October, Dutch startup CodeSandbox raised $12.7 million for a platform that enables developers to create a web app development sandbox in the browser, with collaboration playing a central role. 
I knew just the place to go: CodeSandbox.
 CodeSandbox allows you to use arbitrary NPM packages, and it has a code editor based on VS Code’s own editor. 
 CodeSandbox also sands off some of the rough edges of configuration files and has a lot of premade projects built with various technologies (React, Vue, Redux, and even exotic frameworks like Hyperapp), which makes it easy to get started with the uber-complicated build chain that modern web development seems to require. 
And I was extra excited to see that CodeSandbox has a Vim mode.
 CodeSandbox was all I needed, and my iPad was suddenly an ultra useful webdev box — at least for building the sort of small experiments I gravitate toward. 
 Many Vim users (like myself, for instance) map a fancy key combo like “jj” to make exiting insert mode easier, but CodeSandbox isn’t actually Vim. 
 CodeSandbox, you brought me so close! 
 In fact, based on CodeSandbox’s rapid iteration, I wouldn’t be surprised if they solved this issue in the near future. 
CodeSandbox.io includes its own console interface.
I guess my first job on this new coding setup will be to write a pull request for CodeSandbox to support the “jj” escape method.
 In the software development sphere, this provided a boost for tools such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio Live Share, while upstarts such as CodeSandbox and Replit raised sizable investments to further develop their various browser-based code collaboration platforms. 
 As an early investor, Bucky serves on the boards of some of the most innovative software companies including Netlify, Materialize, CodeSandbox, Opstrace and Stackbit.

 Many IDEs support collaborative use, including Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse and CodeSandbox with its Live feature. 
 CodeSandbox is the most widely used cloud-hosted IDE, often described as VS Code in a browser. 
 Because these Components are self-contained units, they can be brought into platforms like CodeSandbox and they…just…work.

 But you can still use the core text editor part of VS Code in a browser — it’s called Monaco Editor, and it powers one of my favorite web-based coding environments, CodeSandbox. 
 Browser-based IDEs like CodeSandbox bring much of the VS Code experience to a web browser for rapid development, experimentation, and sharing of development efforts. 
 For Cloud-based IDEs, CodeSandbox and StackBlitz have gained significant popularity over the past year due to their impressive feature set for browser-based editing, as well as integration with local development tools. 
 The implementation (visible in a CodeSandbox) uses React exclusively as a DOM library, and uses hyperscript helpers, so the screens follow an html-like form.

 Scheeringa, co-founder of SAR Trilogy Management and former-CEO of Flight Options between 2004 and 2008, says: “A key differentiator of Kambr is the focus on total commercial optimization of a customer versus fare-based revenue management. 
Kambr has also boosted its core team with the appointment of Sean Moriarty as chief technology officer.
 Moriarty, who joins from Accelya-owned Revenue Management Systems, heads up Kambr’s development team. 
Kambr says it has two further airline customers in the pipeline on top of the three it signed in the past year.
 Travel-tech startup Kambr has continued to grow through customer acquisition, funding and personnel additions The leadership team has the vision and practical experience to transform revenue management practices; and is providing airlines a powerful tool in the post-COVID-19 demand world. 
 In a time when much of the industry has been curtailed, travel-tech startup Kambr has continued to grow through customer acquisition, funding and personnel additions despite the global pandemic and air travel demand shock. 
 Kambr closed its latest seed round of $3 million, bringing the travel-tech startup’s total funding to $7 million. 
The additional funds will be used to accelerate Kambr’s product development initiatives and scale its commercial operations.
 Private equity investors Jim Collis and Bill Luby and industry veteran Michael Scheeringa lead the latest round, joining the ranks of Kambr investor including, Founder Collective, Global Founders Capital, Studio VC, Silicon Badia, C2 Ventures Capital Partners and TXV Partners who invested in the previous round. 
 “A key differentiator of Kambr is the focus on total commercial optimization of a customer versus fare-based revenue management,” said investor S. 
Kambr also announced the hiring of Sean Moriarty as its Chief Technology Officer.
 Leaving his 14-year tenure at Revenue Management Systems - An Accelya Group Company, Moriarty comes on board to accelerate innovation, as Kambr continues to lead airlines to new levels of productivity and performance for their revenue analysts. 
 “I’ve seen firsthand how frustrating it can be when airlines feel like they are not getting ahead of the curve, so I find Kambr’s trailblazing approach to be very refreshing and necessary.” 
 Moriarty will lead Kambr’s growing development team, working closely with co-founder Michael Peters, applying their product and industry acumen to deliver revenue management solutions that un-constrain revenue analysts, freeing up time so they can do more meaningful, revenue generating work at a fraction of the cost. 
 In addition to publicly announcing software deals with three airlines in the past year, Kambr has signed two other airlines soon to be announced. 
 Chilean Sky Airline, Russian Ural Airlines and Turkish Corendon Airlines have all been impressed with both the software and the consultation provided by Kambr. 
   Kambr's team and system are much more flexible. 
 Therefore, it was easy to make a decision because Kambr is willing to apply their expertise to fit our specific needs. 
One of Kambr’s unique selling points is its product’s ability to seamlessly plug into an airline’s existing tech stack instead of uprooting entire systems.
“Kambr has a strong product vision which fits well with our strategic objectives.
 In addition, we highly value the Kambr team’s expertise and support.” 
 Kambr, an Utrecht, The Netherlands-based travel-tech startup, raised $3m in additional seed funding.

AirAsia Aims for Streamlined Revenue Management & Data Science Processes with Kambr's Eddy Software AirAsia’s strategy and commitment to continually embrace greater innovation demands a world-class solution.
One of the unique features of Kambr’s platform is its flexibility.
 At the center of Asia’s largest low-cost carrier’s systems overhaul is Eddy, Kambr’s revenue management software, which brings greater agility, fresh data insights and an intuitive working environment for its analysts. 
One of the unique features of Kambr’s platform is its flexibility.
 “The implementation phase, designed and carried out by Kambr Advisory, was quick and painless. 
 We are proud of this partnership with Kambr and look forward to continued collaboration in the future,” she added. 
Kambr’s Eddy facilitates the efficiency and streamlined workflow needed for the Southeast Asian carrier’s extensive team of analysts to manage the numerous variables and scale of its operations.
One game-changing element in the project was how quickly Kambr’s workflow enabled the bespoke departments of revenue management and data science to come together and work in a cooperative and efficient manner.
 “Having a tool as open and flexible as Kambr’s Eddy solution will help us increase revenue for existing products and create more business opportunities through leveraging synergies in the ecosystem, which is especially important in today’s rapidly changing environment,” said Paul Carroll, AirAsia’s Head of Route Revenue. 
 Kambr’s Advisory team worked closely with AirAsia’s revenue analyst team through the remote technology setup and configuration to create an optimal workflow and process improvement, considering the airline’s business practices and commercial objectives. 
 Together we’re building the future for commercial airlines, ushering in a new era of efficiency, collaboration and intelligent automation,” said Jason Kelly, CEO, Kambr.

 Kambr: How Lift Happens   Revenue management is on the cusp of transformation. 
 Airlines need systems that embrace new data and technology and manage the entire commercial process,   said Swoop President Steven Greenway, one of several initial Kambr clients. 
   Kambr has the domain expertise and vision to deliver this future.   
 Commercial airline intelligence platform Kambr Inc. has officially launched with the closing of its $4M seed funding round, as the online and travel tech marketplace is poised to reach $1 trillion with 11 percent annual growth rates. 
Kambr operates at the epicenter of an airline industry that is urgently seeking solutions to disentangle fragmented booking and passenger services operations.
 To meet airlines’ new embrace of interactivity, mobility, automation and machine learning that are impacting all industries, Kambr’s team combines an innovative tech stack along with collective decades of expertise across aviation, online advertising and digital media to advance the future of commercial aviation. 
 The goal of Kambr and its family of products is to provide the insights, guidance and software; not only to create a better existing infrastructure for airlines, but to propel the entire industry forward,  said Jason Kelly, Kambr CEO. 
   The Kambr team is accomplishing major feats in a market most have considered impossible to innovate in, and we're confident that they're charting a path to success.   
 In addition to Kelly, Kambr’s co-founders are Martin Kaduc, with Michael Peters leading Kambr Solutions and Chris Anthony overseeing Kambr Advisory Group.

 On the other hand, startup revenue management players, notably Connecticut-based Kambr and San Francisco-based Flyr, are nimbler, he said, and their new systems can more readily adapt to real-time changes in market conditions. 
Evidence that at least some airlines are noticing such a difference can be found in the success Kambr and Flyr have had in signing up clients over the course of the pandemic.
 The first airline customer for Kambr's Eddy revenue management solution went live 10 months ago, the company's managing director, Chris Anthony, said. 
Kambr's largest client so far is discount carrier AirAsia.
 In an article published on the Kambr website in January, AirAsia chief commercial officer Amanda Woo touted the ease of integrating the Eddy system. 
   One of the unique features of Kambr's platform is its flexibility. 
Anthony said that Kambr also offers the advantage of being less expensive than legacy competitors.
But Kambr and Flyr aren't guaranteed to win out over the standing market leaders.
 Almost since the band’s formation in 2012, and certainly from the time of their first album, Kambr, released the following year, Fat-Suit have made a virtue of documenting their music on videos. 
 Kambr – Founded in 2019, Kambr’s mission is to raise airline revenue performance. 
 Kambr offers airlines software, advisory services and media expertise to keep them at the top of their game and lift their revenues. 
Here’s a cool inside tip: Kambr is derived from the word ‘camber’ – the shape of the wing which generates lift for flight.

Kambr has raised a total of $7 million since its founding in Amsterdam in 2019.
 “A key differentiator of Kambr is the focus on total commercial optimization of a customer versus fare-based revenue management,” said investor S. 
 One of Kambr’s other marketing points is that its product can plug into an airline’s existing tech stack, instead of uprooting entire systems, the company said. 
 On Tuesday, soon-to-debut Norwegian airline Flyr said it had hired tech vendor Kambr to create a continuous pricing system from scratch. 
 Flyr, a company developing data analytics products that forecast airfare volatility, today revealed (via an interview with Kambr Media) that it has raised over $10 million in second-round funding. 
 Jason Kelly is returning to his old stomping grounds, the flight travel industry, with the launch of an airline revenue management system (RMS) called Kambr, backed by a $4 million funding round. 
 Kambr’s clients are airline revenue analysts, not marketing teams. 
 The company has also launched Kambr Media, a B2B news and content marketing site.

 SurveyMonkey announced today that it has acquired Usabilla, an Amsterdam-based website and app survey company, for $80 million in cash and stock. 
 Zander Lurie, CEO at SurveyMonkey, said Usabilla filled in a missing piece in its survey toolkit. 
Usabilla CEO Marc van Agteren says his company is adding a complementary product to SurveyMonkey.
 For example, if there is a bug on the page, the user can click the Usabilla tool, capture the area of the page that’s problematic as a screenshot and send it with a comment to the website or app owner for review. 
 With Usabilla, SurveyMonkey gains a stronger foothold in the EU as the company’s headquarters in Amsterdam will become the SurveyMonkey’s largest EU office. 
 In addition, it can now access Usabilla’s 450 customers, which include Lufthansa, Philips and Vodafone. 
 Lurie said there is some customer overlap, but given that the majority of Usabilla’s customers are outside the U.S., there would likely be a net customer gain from the purchase. 
Usabilla was founded in 2009 and raised a modest $1 million along the way.
 SAN MATEO, Calif. and AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands, April 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SurveyMonkey (Nasdaq: SVMK), a leading global survey software company, announced today it has completed its acquisition of Usabilla, a leading global Voice of Customer (VoC) technology provider. 
 Usabilla empowers 450 enterprises in 35 countries, including global brands like Lufthansa, Philips, and Vodafone to collect, analyze and act on real-time user feedback to improve their products and customer experiences. 
 “We welcome Usabilla’s team, product, and customers as we begin a new chapter at SurveyMonkey–one where we have an enhanced enterprise-grade product offering, wider geographic footprint, and stronger go-to-market channel,” said Zander Lurie, chief executive officer of SurveyMonkey. 
 “Usabilla’s deep expertise helping top global brands improve their products and customer experiences is perfectly aligned with our mission, and together, we will deliver significant value to our enterprise customers and shareholders.” 
 “To put the customer at the center and make smarter business decisions, more firms are leveraging VoC technologies to get to rich, meaningful, and contextual insights,” said Faith Adams, senior analyst, Customer Experience at Forrester that included Usabilla as a VoC specialist in their 2018 Now Tech report . “Achieving best-in-class customer experience (CX) requires firms to extend their efforts beyond a specific channel or line of business. 
 Over 130 Usabilla employees will join the SurveyMonkey family, bringing the total number to more than 1,000 employees across 10 offices , including new locations in Amsterdam, New York, London and Berlin. 
 Going forward, the SurveyMonkey and Usabilla teams plan to leverage their combined global footprint and product offerings to grow enterprise sales and capitalize on the market opportunity. 
 Usabilla empowers brands like Lufthansa, Philips, and Vodafone to become truly customer-centric by improving digital experiences on websites, apps and emails.

SurveyMonkey is uniting its GetFeedback and Usabilla product lines under the GetFeedback Suite.
 The suite will combine all of SurveyMonkey's current customer experience solutions under one umbrella, including the GetFeedback CX platform built for Salesforce, and Usabilla, which offers digital experience capabilities that bring real-time feedback from websites and apps. 
SurveyMonkey will continue to offer both GetFeedback and Usabilla to organizations globally while working to integrate the two product lines into a multichannel CX offering.
Cybersecurity software provider SimSpace was one of the companies to combine Usabilla and GetFeedback together.
   Using Usabilla and GetFeedback together was the only way we could meet those needs, so we are excited to see the two products come together as the ultimate customer experience surveying solution.

 With this sustained effort, Usabilla’s software is constantly evolving to fit customer needs. 
 As an organization, Usabilla truly breathes customer-centricity and empowers clients in their efforts to do the same.

 Soon after implementing its first Usabilla feedback form, Ferguson uncovered the biggest pain point for customers on Ferguson.com—search and product findability. 
A follow-up Usabilla survey also showed overall improvement and significant decreases in negative feedback.
 Ferguson carries the saying, “Our job is never over,” and with the help of Usabilla feedback, its teams are alerted to additional pain points to address.

 The report finds overall customer satisfaction with the level of automation brands currently offer, with 66 percent responding in the affirmative when asked if brands were creating enough opportunities to eliminate human interaction, according to Usabilla’s 2018 report, “In the Age of Automation, Customers Want More Human, Less Machine.”

 The company said its Lieferando service, which operates in 50 German cities, would now also offer groceries. 
 Lieferando   intends to run its grocery business at gross profit neutral,   Takeaway said in a statement. 
   It is much nicer to do this job now than when there was snow on the ground,   Miguel laughs, as he cycles through a leafy Berlin park by the river under the midday May sun, clad in the ubiquitous bright orange Lieferando delivery uniform. 
 As soon as the app is activated, Miguel, who did not want to use his real name, is also handing over his phone's GPS information to supervisors and managers of Lieferando. 
The app tells him that he was three minutes late in the delivery; another data point that will be saved for the managers of Lieferando to examine if they wish.
 Miguel is one of 5,000 new delivery drivers that Lieferando, Germany's biggest food delivery service, hired since the first lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. 
 But in a statement to DW, Lieferando denied misusing drivers' data:   It is needed to assign orders to drivers and for the 'food tracker' feature that allows restaurants and consumers to check the status of their order. 
 Konstantin, aged 32, moved from his home country Greece to Berlin last year to kick off a career in web development and has worked for Lieferando part-time since March. 
Lieferando is the most popular food delivery service in Germany
 It is impossible to estimate an average salary for Lieferando drivers in Berlin, as so many work only for a few hours a week, but for someone like Miguel it gives him a little over €1,000 a month. 
But Lieferando is only one of many delivery companies out on the streets of Berlin.
 Unlike Lieferando, many of these do not directly employ workers, instead contracting them out through third parties. 
   Lieferando will do just about the minimum that is allowed under German law in terms of data security, payments and workers' rights,   Miguel added, shrugging. 
 Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway, a food ordering and delivery company, has announced that it would launch a supermarket delivery service in Germany via its Lieferando.de service. 
 Just Eat Takeaway also mentions that its Lieferando service, which operates in 50 German cities, would also offer groceries. 
Lieferando is a mobile app to order food online from restaurants.
 While it operates as Just Eat in the UK, Takeaway.com leads in the Netherlands and it is Pyszne in Polish (Delicious) and Lieferando in German – all shaped by a patchwork of acquisitions throughout the years. 
 Top Companies in the Global Takeaway Food Delivery Market are – Pizza.de, Lieferheld, Lieferando.de, Takeaway.com, Delivery Hero2020-2025 
 At worst, the startup will be successful enough at growing its business so as to become an acquisition target when the market starts consolidating, as when the likes of Delivery Hero and Lieferando were acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in Germany. 
 It just so happens that some takeout orders may make you happier than others, at least, that's what an experiment conducted by the German food delivery app Lieferando suggests. 
 The team at Lieferando studied 2,158 people throughout 2020 and analyzed their emotional reactions to 11 different types of cuisine ordered for takeout. 
 According to Lieferando, ordering Chinese cuisine boosted happiness levels by as much as 58%. 
But the real dagger came last December when the Dutch food delivery giant Takeaway.com — known in Germany as Lieferando — effectively tied up the German food delivery business for itself with its purchase of Delivery Hero's extensive operations in the country for $1.1 billion (€990 million).
 Takeaway.com, which goes under the Lieferando brand in Germany, has effectively got the German online food delivery market all sewn up with the departure of Deliveroo 
 Delivery Hero, which owned the long established order-platforms Lieferheld, Pizza.de and Foodora, was locked in a battle for supremacy with Lieferando. 
Any hopes Deliveroo had of muscling in on the duopoly were effectively dashed by the December deal which saw Lieferando take over Delivery Hero's operations.
 That model still accounts for around 95% of all food deliveries, with much of Lieferando's business operating that way. 
 Lieferando, Pizza.de, Lieferheld, lieferservice.de, Deliveroo and Foodora all battled it out to win the right to deliver Germans dinner. 
 “Now there’s only one brand left, which does marketplace delivery,” he says — Lieferando, as Takeaway.com’s German operation is known, connects customers with restaurants which mostly fulfil deliveries using their own delivery drivers. 
 The deal covers all of Delivery Hero’s operations in Germany, which include the Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora brands, which will now merge with Takeaway.com’s Lieferando.de brand. 
 He's working for the tech company Lieferando, delivering food from restaurants to customers' homes. 
 Takeaway.com — the parent company of Lieferando, which dominates the web-based food delivery market in Germany — responded to the outbreak by issuing a statement to its customers and workers in Europe. 
 The precaution is not a requirement, however, and cash delivery was still available on Lieferando's website at the time of publication. 
 The hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant is behind the curve, but they've started the process of registering with the delivery platform Lieferando. 
 German fast food delivery portal Lieferando has started accepting Bitcoin for orders, as the first player in the industry to do so. 
 As part of a package of updates released to users this week, Lieferando, owned by the international umbrella company Takeaway.com, added Bitcoin for all its partner restaurants. 
The new payment method is available on both Lieferando’s website and via its app.
 Jitse Groen, founder and CEO of the Germany-based food delivery service Takeaway (Lieferando.de), announced on March 18 that his company had suffered a DDoS attack. 
 @thuisbezorgd @lieferando @pysznepl pic.twitter.com/YMwSJUOoJn — Jitse Groen (@jitsegroen) March 18, 2020 
 Shortly after Groen issued his tweet, Lieferando.de tweeted out its own disclosure about the attack. 
 https://t.co/2m00je8xHe — Lieferando.de (@lieferando) March 18, 2020 
Some customers responded to Lieferando.de’s tweet with complaints that the company had accepted new orders despite its systems being unavailable due to the DDoS attack.
 Under these conditions, many Germans order in through food delivery services like Takeaway.com (Lieferando.de). 
 Lieferando boasts food delivery from more than 15,000 restaurants in Germany, so the impact of a DDoS attack is significant; not just for customers but for restaurant owners, too. 
 At the time of publishing, Lieferando website was up and running. 
 In recent years it has acquired Berlin-based food ordering startup Lieferando and Delivery Hero’s German food delivery businesses Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora. 
 MUNICH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The yourdelivery group, which includes online food ordering portals in Germany (www.lieferando.de), Austria (www.lieferando.at), Switzerland (www.lieferando.ch), France (www.taxiresto.fr) and Poland (www.smakuje.pl) is set to expand the Polish division of its business with the acquisition of local competitor pyszne.pl (www.pyszne.pl). 
 In Germany, lieferando.de is already the provider offering the most delivery services. 
 After our short-term goal of market leadership in Germany, we will seek to achieve the same in continental Europe,' explains Jörg Gerbig, co-founder and CEO of lieferando.de. 
 The yd. yourdelivery GmbH is active in five countries with its online food ordering platforms, which includes lieferando.de (www.lieferando.de) lieferando.at (www.lieferando.at) lieferando.ch (www.lieferando.ch) taxiresto.fr (www.taxiresto.fr) and smakuje.pl (www.smakuje.pl).

A new PS5 Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart bundle appears to be releasing alongside the full game tomorrow.
 Last week, a French retailer already made mention of the rumored bundle, and since then, various images of this PS5 Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart have found their way online. 
 According to the retailer, the bundle includes the PS5 disc version, a DualSense controller, and a retail copy of Insomniac’s new Ratchet & Clank installment on Sony’s next-gen console. 
 Apparently, the bundle will be sold for €569.99 with the retailer reporting that around 10,000 to 12,000 bundles will be made available by Sony. 
 Down below you’ll find some images of the alleged new PS5 bundle (courtesy of retailer Station of Play), which, if legit, will be the first official new bundle that Sony launches following the console’s release last November. 
 On June 8th, just four days after it launched, the Itch.io indie bundle for Palestinian Aid smashed its fundraising target of $500,000 (around £354,000). 
 You have two days left to grab the bundle now, and help push the fundraising total a little closer to $1 million. 
 The bundle's featured game is Liyla And The Shadows Of War, a survival story game about a girl living in Gaza in 2014, made by Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh. 
 There are hundreds of other games included too, such as Pikuniku, Minit, Signs Of The Sojourner, Moon Hunters, Glittermitten Grove and VVVVVV - and those are just a few highlights from a quick scroll on the bundle's main page. 
 You can buy the Indie bundle for Palestinian Aid on Itch.io for a minium price of $5 (about £3.70), though you can choose to pay more if you want. 
 At the time of writing, the bundle has raised over $598,000 (roughly £424,000), well over its initial $500k goal. 
 If you don't fancy the games bundle but still want to help with relief efforts, we have a list of charities you could donate to, which includes organisations like Doctors Without Borders, Action Aid, Save The Children and more. 
Amazon’s Fire 10 Productivity bundle combines the new Fire HD 10 tablet with a generic Bluetooth keyboard case and a year of Microsoft 365 Personal for $219.99.
 From a hardware perspective, it delivers, especially if you get the Fire HD 10 Plus Productivity Bundle, which has the HD 10 Plus' extra gigabyte of RAM. 
 This feels like a missed opportunity for the Fire HD 10 Plus Productivity Bundle in particular, since the Fire HD 10 Plus has wireless charging. 
 This bundle's other substantial addition is a yearlong subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal, which would otherwise cost $69.99. 
 If your work requires anything more than typing words into a Microsoft Word document, go with the Duet and leave this   productivity   bundle on the shelf.

 No trackpad The Bottom Line A bundle of Amazon's newly upgraded Fire HD 10 tablet, a keyboard case, and Microsoft 365 Personal makes for an interesting attempt at a productivity tablet, but Amazon's Appstore lacks too many of the apps you need. 
 Itch's Indie bundle for Palestinian Aid, a huge charity collection of over a thousand games, tabletop RPGs, soundtracks and more, has raised over $500,000 for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's efforts in providing food and aid to people in Gaza. 
 Running throughout the week, the Palestine bundle follows in the footsteps of last year's Bundle for Racial Justice, which raised over $8.5 million for legal defence funds in the US. 
The centrepiece of the bundle is Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh's Liyla and the Shadows of War.
 Like last year, buying the bundle will also send you a link to a page full of downloads, rather than flooding your itch library with 1,019 games all at once. 
 With three days still to go, here's hoping the bundle can cross the million mark before the end of the week. 
It's also welcoming to see that last year's bundle wasn't just a one-off.

 Some games are guaranteed to be a hit with consumers, and when they are also a console exclusive, we usually get a console/game bundle. 
And it looks as though Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is set to be the first game bundled with a PS5.
French news site Station of Play tweeted images of what looks to be a hardware bundle Sony is expected to release on the same day.
 If this bundle launches in the US, the price is likely to be closer to $570, although the chances of actually securing one is going to be low due to demand and will come down to pure luck in most cases. 
 Sales of the PS5 are thought to be double that of the Xbox Series X and Series S, and this bundle will surely help to at least maintain that lead for Sony. 
 State of Play also claims France has been allocated up to 12,000 units of the bundle, which if true, will likely be mirrored across other countries in Europe.

Microsoft June Security Patch Bundle Addresses 49 Vulnerabilities
 Five CVEs in this month's bundle were rated   Critical   by researchers, with the rest deemed   Important.   
This relatively light June security patch load is somewhat overshadowed by this month's bundle bringing patches for six CVEs that were known to have been exploited before this update Tuesday release.
 Also, three CVEs in this month's bundle were publicly known before Microsoft's Tuesday disclosure and patch release. 
 The six zero-day vulnerabilities in this month's patch bundle, per Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative blog, include:

 An indie bundle for Palestinian Aid, featuring over a thousand games, tabletop games, books, soundtracks, and more, has raised over $500,000. 
 The bundle launched last week (June 5), taking inspiration from last year’s Bundle For Racial Justice And Equality.

 On Monday June 7, @ValorLeaks on Twitter released a leak of a new VALORANT skin bundle, Origin. 
Here is the look at the leaked VALORANT Origin skin bundle:
Origin Bundle Skins | #VALORANT ~ Origin Vandal
The leaked VALORANT Origin skin bundle is another skin bundle that seems to be heavily influenced by an advanced technology theme.
 This bundle will include an Origin Vandal, Origin Frenzy, Origin Operator, Origin Bucky and Origin Knife. 
 Each of these guns are fairly popular in VALORANT’s meta, so this makes this Origin skin bundle that much more exciting. 
The Origin skin bundle can also be upgraded.
The upgraded Origin bundle features a unique firing sound as well as reload animation.
The Origin knife is the only portion of the bundle that does not seem as sleek as the guns.
Check out Youtuber DiegoteTV’s video on the Origin skin bundle to view the awesome animation features of the leaked skin bundle:
 All in all, the Origin skin bundle features popular guns as well as nice color variants. 
This combined with the sleek animations are sure to make the Origin skin bundle popular amongst players.

 Branch Insurance, a startup offering bundled home and auto insurance, has raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Anthemis Group. 
Branch claims that it is unique in that it is able to provide customers with “an instant insurance offer” for bundled home and auto insurance “within seconds” using just a few pieces of information.
 Branch, he claims, is the only insurance company that he is aware of that can bind insurance through an API, and the only one that can bundle auto and home insurance in a single transaction. 
 “Branch’s products are both embedded and bundled, making them less expensive and more convenient to purchase, and less likely to leave customers with critical protection gaps.”

 The Streaming Toolbox: Zixi, Cleeng, and Penthera 
Cleeng offers a customer insights tool called ChurnIQ that's focused on the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) market—ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) is on the road map—that provides answers for questions like this.
Cleeng has examined nearly a decade's worth of data to find metrics that correlate strongly with performance outcomes.
   We focus on two different ideas: the overall product usage model and engagement at the individual level,   says Damien Organ, senior product designer at Cleeng. 
 While there are many types of relevant KPIs, Cleeng recommends that most companies focus on these four: 
   For Cleeng clients we find similar outcomes, with an average of around 65% of trials converting overall, and top performers converting at 75 to 80%,   the report notes. 
 ChurnIQ is available standalone or as part of Cleeng's subscriber management platform, and pricing varies according to audience size. 
 AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cleeng, the leader in video e-commerce solutions for broadcasters, announces a Series B funding round of €5 Million to drive product development and growth in key markets. 
 With the new funding, Cleeng will up its sales and marketing efforts, broaden its partner network and further invest in research and development. 
The additional funding strengthens Cleeng’s leading position in the Direct-to-Consumer video industry.
 “The OTT market is booming, and this investment will allow us to reinforce our core competencies and create the best platform for broadcasters to succeed in delivering Direct-to-Consumer strategies”, said Gilles Domartini, founder and CEO of Cleeng. 
 Vincent Gravesteyn, Managing Director at Walvis, commented “Cleeng’s team has built a highly reliable and technically advanced video e-commerce platform for the broadcasting ecosystem. 
Cleeng’s innovation in this space offers valuable opportunities for business efficiencies”.
 He continued, “Walvis invests in entrepreneurs with game-changing technologies and global ambitions, and we are excited to work together with Cleeng’s leadership team to create an international market leader.” 
 Colin Morrison, VP Sales at TiVo and 25-year industry veteran will join Cleeng’s supervisory board along with Vincent Gravesteyn and existing board member Olivier Huez from C4 Ventures, the investment fund founded by Pascal Cagni. 
 Cleeng offers the smartest way to sell live and on-demand video, direct to consumers. 
 The Cleeng platform and APIs are built for scalability, flexibility and is deeply integrated with the leading streaming and front-end providers. 
 Cleeng was founded in 2011 by former Apple, Philips and NEC e-commerce and media experts. 
 Gilles Domartini, chief executive and founder of Cleeng, offers his take on the ever-growing world of over-the-top (OTT). 
 At Cleeng, we opted for a video focused, data-driven, 360 degree take on churn and identified three major groups of churn generators: payment, engagement, and satisfaction. 
 The product itself called Cleeng ChurnIQ empowers OTT broadcasters to tackle churn at all the phases of the customer journey, from login to payment, consumption, ending with customer care. 
 That’s why Cleeng is the preferred tech partner to many leading sports brands and suppliers, like Ostmodern, Maestro.io, Brightcove etc. 
 In a recent example, SportsMax, the leading sports broadcaster in the Caribbean, set up a dedicated sports channel with Cleeng and broadcasted all the live games via a streaming app. 
That’s the benefit of using Cleeng.

Subscriber retention management (SRM) solutions provider Cleeng has announced the launch of a new analytics suite.
 Gilles Domartini, CEO and founder of Cleeng, said: “Subscriber retention management is at the heart of our strategy. 
 Cleeng will be showcasing the SRM dashboard IBC 2019 in Hall 21, stand 14. 
 The company says that it will help provide a consistent user experience across all devices, the flexibility to easily expand and customize functionality, and integration with the Verizon Media Platform as well as with other members of the Verizon Media extensions programme, such as Cleeng, which handles authentication, user management and entitlements. 
 “The first challenge is to build premium content … it has to be very unique,” says Gilles Domartini, chief executive and founder of Amsterdam-based Cleeng, a web service provider that helps publishers put up paywalls or registration gateways around their content. 
VentureBeat worked with Cleeng early in 2012 to present a five-question registration form to readers before letting them watch a live video webinar.
(Disclosure: Cleeng provided the service to us for free so that we could review it.)
 “By deploying the Cleeng solution, the conversion rates from the webinar were much higher than normal, and completion rates for the registration form were close to 100 percent,” VentureBeat’s director of marketing and ad operations Garrett McCullum told me. 
 In addition to video, Cleeng can also provide paywall-restricted access to HTML pages, PDF files, and a variety of other content — and it can do so on a wide range of platforms, including HTML5-based mobile websites. 
 One of Cleeng’s selling points is the simplicity of its user interface, a design aesthetic that, Domartini says, stems from his experience working for Apple. 
 So when he came to start Cleeng, he said, “we started from the user standpoint and thought, what do we need to do to have a technology that would work on any device, for any content, and it would ‘just work,’ from the user perspective.” 
Cleeng integrates with WordPress (as a plugin).
 Cleeng also provides content paywall services to video publishing platforms, including Dailymotion, Brightcove, and Livestream. 
Cleeng was founded in 2011 and currently has 12 employees.
 Meanwhile, MXGP’s newest partner, Cleeng, will manage the e-commerce activities on MXGP-TV and will also provide customer support, with anything MXGP-TV related. 
I would like to thank all the team at StreamAMG and Cleeng for their collaboration and all the dedicated team of Infront Moto Racing for the great work accomplished.
 Gilles Domartini, Cleeng CEO and Founder: “We are thrilled to support MXGP TV’s Direct to Consumer’s strategy, and partner with StreamAMG. 
 MXGP TV is leveraging Cleeng’s full SRM stack, so to provide a frictionless and cost-efficient user experience, from identity & offer management, payment and tax handling in many countries, as well as multilingual customer care experiences. 
 Cleeng, a WordPress plugin that lets anyone from casual bloggers to professional publishers charge for whole articles, parts of articles or indeed any element of a page, is now out of private beta and taking sign-ups from the public. 
 As we reported last month, Cleeng lets its users offer a “halfway-house” between a free website and a paywalled one. 
 Cleeng focuses on small payments, allowing publishers to charge between $0.15 and $0.99. 
 Netherlands-based Cleeng says that it has already attracted 200 content producers, including 40 publishers, and is in discussions with several major European newspapers and magazines to provide content monetization solutions for their websites. 
 For an example of how it works, take a look at this page and scroll down the Cleeng-branded section. 
Cleeng’s approach of “teasing” content is interesting as it allows publishers to easily tweak exactly how much content they monetize.
 The “tease” approach may frustrate and drive away readers unwilling to pay, of course, so getting that balance right will be key to making a success of using Cleeng on a website. 
Cleeng is open for publishers to sign up to today.
The event will be streamed exclusively via online sports broadcaster Cleeng with a PPV listing of AU$30.00.
ERUPTION MUAY THAI 20 VIA CLEENG
 The paid service is powered by content monetization startup Cleeng, and lets online viewers buy TV episodes and live shows in a few clicks. 
 From the viewer’s perspective, the purchase process is very straightforward, which is not very surprising, since it is entirely supported by Cleeng and its API. 
 A few months later, it unveiled Cleeng Play, which lets users monetize Vimeo Pro videos. 
 According to its founder and CEO Gilles Domartini, this partnership with Dailymotion is a recognition of Cleeng’s work so far, and is likely to boost its growth: 
 Whilst Cleeng have been around for nearly 2 years now, the collaboration with Dailymotion is a major coup for a company of our stature as we helped to find a way to make OpenVOD work for all parties. 
 With major companies such as France Télévisions, Cinetel and Journeyman Pictures all placing content on OpenVOD, it also provides an opportunity to get Cleeng’s name out to major players in the media industry. 
 Once users click on the ‘Watch now’ button, they are taken to Dailymotion’s payment platform, which is powered by Cleeng, and offers different options for each territory, such as credit card transaction, PayPal transfer, premium SMS and payment by phone. 
 According to Domartini, Cleeng’s support goes beyond payments, as the startup is providing full e-commerce support backup, including customer service and reporting tools.

 ParkBee was founded in 2015 in the Netherlands and has offices in Amsterdam and London, employing 50 people in all. 
The app allows drivers to locate and reserve available spaces in off-street car parks and be directed to those spaces through the ParkBee app and affiliates such as Google Maps.
 With full responsibility for the leadership and development of ParkBee in London, De Rauville will play a key role in meeting the company’s ambitious growth goals in London and the UK. 
 She said: “As one of the world’s first digital car park operators, ParkBee’s aim is linking drivers to convenient off-street parking locations while helping property owners and local authorities to make better, more efficient use of existing urban space. 
 By optimising existing car parking, ParkBee creates more room in towns and cities for people and maximises revenue for landlords and tenants.” 
We do not see any impediments to achieve our goal and we are looking forward to this next stage in the ParkBee journey as we roll-out our strategy in this region.”
 Werner Paul Boerma, CEO ParkBee: “Angelique’s track record, international experience, and management skills are impressive, so we are thrilled having her on board. 
We are convinced she will effectively lead our team in London and realise our intended expansion in the UK together with the great team that has already proven ParkBee is in an excellent position to create substantial value for real estate owners and consumers.
 ParkBee optimises occupancy rates in parking locations through data and smart technology for reservations, dynamic pricing and direct integration in large parking and mobility platforms of, amongst others, Parkmobile, Yellowbrick and ANWB. 
 ParkBee, a Netherlands-founded startup that lets private car parks monetize underutilized spaces by making them bookable to the public, has picked up €5 million in new funding 
 Originally launched in Amsterdam in early 2016 where it now has over 60 parking locations, ParkBee says the new capital will be used for further U.K. expansion after the burgeoning company recently brought its offering to London. 
 Specifically, this consists of hardware ParkBee had to develop that is retrofitted to a private car park’s existing barrier or security system. 
 “Parking is an enormous hassle in every large city, and streets are only getting fuller, whilst the parking capacity is there but not yet accessible for the general public,” ParkBee commercial director Wouter de Bruijne tells me. 
ParkBee opens up these locations to the public”.
 To that end, the list of private property companies ParkBee is already working with include JLL, BT and local councils in the U.K. 
 Meanwhile, the ParkBee business model is straightforward. 
ParkBee is a digital car park operator with a clear goal.
 By continuously analysing and optimizing our online channels you will contribute to the revenue growth of ParkBee in the Netherlands, UK and the new regions ParkBee is expanding too. 
To expand our digital footprint in order to find new revenue opportunities for ParkBee.
We motivate each other to get the best out of ParkBee and ourselves!
We believe in personal development and in the cooperation of our teams: that's how we make ParkBee a success.
 Development and growth opportunities: next to the growth of ParkBee and potential expansions, you’ll have the possibility to grow to a senior position and build a performance team. 
Are you ready to become ParkBee’s first Performance Marketing Specialist and help our scale-up reach the next level of business?
 ParkBee, a tech startup with smart technology to open up private car parks to the public, has announced it closed €5 million in funding to scale its business in the UK. 
 With in excess of 60 locations in the Netherlands and over 20 locations opened in the last months in the UK, ParkBee has proven its potential, by using smart technology that enables users to open up the barriers and doors from the RingGo and Parkmobile apps. 
 Tom Buchmann, Co-Founder and Managing Director of ParkBee, commented: “‘It’s hard to believe that there are so many unused parking spaces in London, whilst parking in London is such a hassle. 
The ParkBee technology is fully compatible to any parking system and provides seamless entry for the consumer.
 ParkBee installs it’s smart hardware at the location and via their integrated software the location can be opened remotely via the Parkmobile and RingGo apps –in the UK alone, RingGo has 12 million registered users. 
The real-estate owner keeps control and can still manage the availability and ParkBee will optimise the occupancy of the location.
 Stefan Hülsen, Senior Investment Manager at Statkraft Ventures, said: “ParkBee is a fantastic example of a company providing a solution to a problem witnessed in many cities and large towns. 
By making optimal use of the parking spots that are already available ParkBee opens-up new opportunities to park.
 ParkBee is a prime example of a company enabling cities to become smarter and fairer, while empowering citizens and businesses to improve and solve a problem.” 
Founded in 2013 in the Netherlands by Jian Jiang and Tom Buchmann ParkBee aims to fix the problem of parking in big cities through technology.
 In London alone, according to a study commissioned by Transport for London*, there are over 1 million private parking spots, with the value of a 20-spot garage hitting easily £50,000 in annual revenue for the owner (based on calculations made by ParkBee). 
 The list of private property companies ParkBee is already working with include JLL, BT and local councils. 
 Jont Cole, COO at JLL Professional & Advisory and Alternatives, added: “JLL is engaging with ParkBee to enable landlords to secure additional revenue from under-utilised car parking.

 Owlin, a startup we covered all the way back in late 2012, has raised $3.5 million in Series A funding. 
 The investment will enable Amsterdam-based Owlin to accelerate its growth internationally, especially in the U.K. and the U.S. The company’s international clients include Fitch Ratings, Adyen, Deutsche Bank, ING, and KPMG. 
 “We started with delivering news signals to dealing room environments with our platform,” Owlin co-founder and CEO Sjoerd Leemhuis recalls. 
 This is seeing Owlin enable 15,000 counter-party risk managers worldwide to track risk events that are not captured by traditional credit risk metrics. 
 In the end, our clients don’t just gain insights, they also gain time,” adds the Owlin CEO. 
 Meanwhile, Owlin’s Series A isn’t just a lesson in finding market fit but also in tenacity. 
This left Owlin falling back on a bootstrap strategy and being extremely cautious when choosing a next investor.
 Owlin, an Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based AI-driven text and news analytics platform for the financial industry, secured $3.5m in funding. 
 Led by Sjoerd Leemhuis, CEO, Owlin provides a natural language text and news analytics platform to monitor the user’s environment proactively, continuously and in real-time. 
 Clients use Owlin for business opportunities, risk management, research or leveraging their business case by integrating the platform with their end user solutions. 
 However, just like his bowling, Anderson too is learning the art from the new English cricketers. 
4. Resorting to owling to relieve tension
Owling is a variation on planking in which a person squats “like an owl” in a populated and uncommon area.
 Before the Lord’s against India in 2011), Anderson, along with Stuart Broad and Steve Finn, resorted to Owling to relieve tension. 
 In Central Park's North Woods and around its Loch, Barry finds an abundance of the prey it likes, doing most of its owlin' out after dusk. 
 All of these owling activities qualify as a real hoot for birders on this island of brick and glass and steel, coronating Barry -- who appears mostly indifferent -- the city's latest celebrity bird. 
 For those who might embark on an owling adventure this season, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Audubon Great Lakes are reminding people that there are certain precautions to take when it comes to safe, ethical viewing of these enchanting birds. 
Another reason why winter is a good time for owling: It’s breeding season for some of Michigan’s native owl species.
 The bottom line, according to the DNR, is to enjoy the magic of Michigan winter owling, but to do so respectfully. 
Triposo uses a sophisticated algorithm to find you the best places to visit wherever you are going.
 From unique historical adventures, to hidden gems of the food world, Triposo allows you to ditch your guidebook and plan a unique trip catered to you. 
 Back in September, Jon Tirsen and Douwe Osinga, two ex-Googlers, unveiled their new mobile travel guide, Triposo, setting out to do for travel content what Google and PageRank did for search. 
 Of course, this is no easy task, and Triposo has been in an ongoing process of honing these content algorithms, launching 30 destination travel guides for iOS and Android to help test the waters and encourage user feedback. 
 Today, Triposo is ready to take its next big step forward, officially unveiling its new and improved iOS app, which aims to make the old hands of travel content, like Lonely Planet, shake in their boots. 
 The main attraction of its new app, says COO Richard Osinga, is that Triposo is now a “self-starter” — in other words, a travel guide that actively offers suggestions as to where users should go next. 
 But what is perhaps the coolest feature of the new Triposo app is that they now register the direction one is looking in, so that as a user roams the streets of a new city, the app highlights the top destinations in front of them. 
 That’s the key to Triposo: It’s free, it works offline so you won’t incur roaming fees, offers travel guides for dozens of countries, more than 8,000 points of interest, and 250K places, has a travel dashboard, weather updates, currency converter, and foreign language phrasebooks. 
 In the eight months since launch, Triposo has seen over 1 million iOS downloads and over 700K Android downloads. 
 The startup’s early traction has continued to make it appealing to investors, as Triposo recently added a second, small-ish tranche of seed funding from new investor CrunchFund, as well as contributions from its existing investors, which include Chris Sacca, Taher Haveliwala, Google Wave Co-founder and Google Maps Lead Engineer Lars Rasmussen, and InterWest Partners. 
 For more, check out Triposo at home here. 
 To create Landed, Triposo used clever algorithms to match airports to cities. 
Triposo is the Amsterdam and Berlin based startup behind Landed and is known for its popular travel guides apps with over 10 million downloads to date.
 Triposo was founded back in 2011 by ex-Googlers Douwe Osinga, Jon Tirsen and diplomat-turned-entrepreneur, Richard Osinga. 
 Today, Triposo is kicking travel up a notch with their latest round of funding and a new series of innovate travel apps designed to enhance in-destination travel experiences. 
 With its latest update Triposo, the travel guide app with 10 M downloads, travelers can now book their complete trip on the go, with hotel deals, attraction tickets, amazing experiences and local tours. 
Triposo is founded by two ex-Googlers and takes an algorithmic approach to travel.
 With this latest update, Triposo is taking recommendations one step further: in just three taps gets you tickets to the places and sights you want to see. 
 “If you do a transaction with Triposo, we store your payment information in a vault.

 To do this, it has acquired Amsterdam-based Triposo, a startup that says it has found an automated way to curate travel recommendations for relevant things to see and do. 
 For example, Triposo’s technology might recommend a visit to a children’s museum to parents traveling with their kids in a small town in Austria. 
The integration means Musement will mix Triposo’s travel recommendations for relevant things to see and do with its bookable activities.
 The overlapping content will appear on Triposo’s and Musement’s websites and mobile apps and via application programming interfaces, which connect to distribution partners, like airlines and online travel agencies. 
 The acquisition is a $7 million stock swap where the investors, including InterWest Partners, Chris Sacca, Lars Rasmussen, Crunch Fund, and others, received Musement shares in return for Triposo stock. 
 Founded in 2011, Triposo was founded by ex-Googlers founded looking to create mobile travel guides using an algorithmic approach. 
 Nishank Gopal took over as Triposo CEO, and the company shifted to focusing on building a business-to-business product, namely, a sophisticated machine-learning and algorithmic platform for content. 
Triposo’s tool parses terabytes of textual travel content online to enable partners to grasp the core characteristics of a destination or a point of interest.
 Among the many, many apps I use all the time are WhatsApp, Adobe Lightroom CC, Couchsurfing, Triposo, Culture Trip, and Google Photos. 
 Let the free Triposo (Android, iOS) app be your guide. 
The company also bought trip planning startup Triposo last year.
 Last year, the airport welcomed 6.2 million passengers in 2018, as opposed to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport’s 46.5 million, according to Triposo. 
 We've teamed up with Triposo, a travel app that lists locations around the world based on the number of positive mentions across social review sites. 
Triposo conducted a survey to learn more about bad tourist behavior abroad.
 That's according to an online, unscientific survey by travel app Triposo, which asked more than 700 travelers about their travel behavior, polling them on everything from travel pet peeves to the adventures they stumble upon while abroad. 
   For a lot of people, travel is a great excuse to let loose and get adventurous,   said Richard Osinga, chief operating officer and founder of Triposo. 
 Travelers with a spontaneous streak will love Triposo, an app that gives you personalized suggestions for things to do on your trip while you're on the go. 
 Before you go on your trip, download Triposo's destination guide to your device, and while you're there, get real-time updates about what's going on nearby. 
 Created by Berlin-based travel app maker Triposo, it’s a belt with embedded buzzers. 
 Plug it into your smartphone via the audio jack, and the Triposo app can guide you around a city by buzzing your midsection to indicate whether you should go left, right, forward, or backward. 
 Tragically, when Triposo tried to fund it by crowdfunding the idea on Indiegogo, it raised less than a third of its goal, leaving the Travel Belt dream in limbo for now. 
 As with many travel guide apps, the content and maps are available offline so you don't bother with roaming bills.Triposo is using content from Wikipedia, Wikitravel, World66 and other open content travel guides to compile up-to-date, rich travel guides for cities around the world. 
Turkey Travel Guide by Triposo is a free app that delivers complete city guides to your smartphone's screen.
Triposo also offers a phrasebook with useful Turkish phrases.
 If Istanbul is not the only stop of your travel in Turkey or if you just need a free app with offline support, you can download the Turkey Travel Guide by Triposo from the App Store or Google Play Store.Ulmon Guides has the one goal to make your journey easy and fun. 
 We’ve teamed up with Triposo, a travel app that lists locations around the world based on the number of positive mentions across social review sites. 
A 2013 survey by the Triposo travel site showed that 42 percent of Russians consider their own countrymen to be “the most ill-behaved” while traversing home soil.
India Travel Guide by Triposo is the best customized mobile application has efficiently substituted heavy guidebooks in the bags of frequent travelers.
The best part of the Triposo travel app is it is available individually for multiple countries and also in one complete travel package app know as World Travel Guide by Triposo.
 Billed as the travel guide for the whole world, Triposo (free) creates guides out of content from open sources like Wikitravel and World66. 
 The airport welcomed 6.2 million passengers in 2018, as opposed to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's 46.5 million, according to Triposo. 
 Kandler says that last year’s 6 million downloads were around four times those of the more high-profile Lonely Planet, and nearly nine times that of Triposo, a venture-backed travel app startup founded by ex-Googlers. 
Triposo conducted a survey to learn more about bad tourist behaviour abroad.
Find out more about what Triposo's survey uncovered about tourist behaviour here.
Triposo puts offline maps and travel guides onto your phone so you can use them even in dead zones.
 Before you download maps and guides for any destination, Triposo tells you how much space they will take up on your phone, too. 
 When you pull up a destination on Triposo, it offers top sightseeing suggestions, a weather forecast, and more ways to explore the destination. 
 Unlike most travel platforms, Musement's content and booking options span multiple verticals, from guided tours and museums to food and wine tastings, across numerous touch-points such as the B2C Musement and Triposo websites and apps, and the joint B2B APIs. 
 There are quite a few startups attacking the tour guide app space which, as well as packaging the traditional (paper) guidebook into a handy app form, are more generally trying to bridge the connectivity gap that tourists face when they take their phone abroad and don’t want to be burnt by roaming costs (e.g. Triposo or PocketGuide). 
 Here at Triposo, we’re no strangers to adventure. 
 Another, Triposo, was acquired last year by Musement for an undisclosed sum. 
 Granted, there are some cool startups, like Triposo and Gogobot out there, but sites and apps like the former are taking an algorithmic approach to travel recommendations — no real people in sight. 
 Unlike most travel platforms, Musement offers content and booking options across multiple verticals, from guided tours and museums, to food & wine - and multiple touch-points; the B2C Musement and Triposo websites and apps, and the joint B2B APIs. 
 Travel agents are then able to take advantage of this and sell high value and high engagement products via voice,” says Nishank Gopalakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer, Triposo. 
 He argues that What Now?!’s daily itinerary map-centric approach makes the experience significantly different to rivals such as Triposo, which also makes interactive offline travel guides but are again following a more well-worn guidebook-style format. 
The travel technology company Triposo is crowdfunding a new navigation gadget that may shock you—literally.
 I used one called Triposo, which was not bad. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the Triposo travel guide app.
 Likewise, Triposo catalogs a lot of the more interesting places to eat and find events You'll find pretty much everything ranging from dance lessons to art openings, and if nothing else it provides a good starting point to figure out what you want to look for. 
 However, the French are not the world’s worst tourists: a recent Triposo survey named Americans No1 for boorish, rude behaviour, followed by British, Russians, the Chinese and Australians. 
 In Istanbul with Adam Hills, they go to the historic Hagia Sophia just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the Triposo app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips.

“Extending our network to TerraPay’s users will provide a convenient and automated channel that customers are looking for.”
 Uniting our strengths will play a pivotal role in expanding TerraPay’s network into new markets and help migrant workers send money home to a mobile wallet or bank account, through a reliable and convenient service,” said Ambar Sur, founder and CEO of TerraPay. 
 TerraPay is the world’s first mobile payments switch- a B2B transaction processing, clearing and settlement service for mobile wallets. 
 TerraPay is a B2B company incubated by Mahindra Comviva, a global leader in delivering mobile financial solutions, itself part of the USD 18 billion Mahindra Group. 
TerraPay is registered and regulated in several jurisdictions.
 As well as Mollie, it already counts Terrapay, Online Payment Platform, Ginger Payments and ManoBank among its roster of clients. 
 TerraPay announced today that a consortium of investors, including Prime Ventures, Partech Africa and management acquired the company for an undisclosed sum. 
 In addition, the same investors, joined by IFC, invested $9.6 million in TerraPay to fund the company’s expansion. 
 TerraPay, a company incubated by Comviva, the India-headquartered mobile solutions provider, provides Payment Infrastructure Services that help more people around the world to transfer money quickly, safely, and affordably. 
 Since its start in 2015, TerraPay has acquired more than 25 licenses to operate in over 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe and is expanding globally. 
 Ambar Sur, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of TerraPay, said: “We believe in our mission to address financial inclusion by making real time national, regional and global payments accessible to everyone. 
TerraPay management developed the fintech company to address the pain points people in many countries experience when trying to make payments across different channels.
 TerraPay is a game-changer because it connects MTOs, mobile money networks and financial institutions to a simple, central platform where all payment players can reliably connect to any financial network, facilitating a seamless end-to-end customer payment experience. 
 TerraPay’s Payments Infrastructure opens the possibility to include merchants traditionally excluded from credit card systems, allow companies to pay salaries through mobile money accounts and help banks to settle remittances in real-time. 
 Pieter Welten, a partner at Prime Ventures said: “We identified TerraPay as an attractive investment opportunity. 
 Led by a strong and experienced management team, TerraPay has a unique market position and strong economic moat comprising of licenses and regulatory approvals, a world-class digital payments platform and global network of partners. 
 Paulo de Bolle, IFC’s Global Director, Financial Institutions Group, said: “By adding TerraPay to IFC’s growing fintech investment portfolio, we are supporting the company to grow and expand, while helping to lower the costs and streamline the process to send money home. 
Fintechs like TerraPay play a vital role in increasing financial inclusion in emerging markets.”
 “We are excited to join efforts with an outstanding group of investors and a superb team for the next part of TerraPay’s journey,” said Cyril Collon, General Partner at Partech Africa. 
“We have been impressed by the cutting-edge platform TerraPay’s teams have developed.
 Since its inception, the TerraPay founders focused on: (i) developing a robust, scalable and agile tech platform; and (ii) compliance and the acquisition of payment intermediary and money transfer licenses. 
 TerraPay has built partnerships with global money transfer companies including Western Union, Visa, Xpress Money, MoneyTrans, Paga, Ria, Instant Cash, Ripple and MoneyGram. 
 Manoranjan Mohapatra, Chief Executive Officer of Comviva said: “We have been proud to be part of the progress that TerraPay has made over the last five years. 
TerraPay’s forward path is in alignment with that underlying purpose.”
 TerraPay has been advised by the FinTech M&A team of specialized investment bank Kempen & Co and the FinTech/M&A team of the Dutch full service law firm Van Doorne, led by Friso Foppes.

ORIX Credit Corporation and Innovative Financial Risk Specialist AdviceRobo have announced that they have started to work together to explore the potential of innovative alternative credit scoring in ORIX card loan services.
ORIX Credit plans to incorporate AdviceRobo's psychographic credit scoring solution into its loan application process in Japan.
 Leveraging its financial services industry expertise and AI capabilities, AdviceRobo has built several innovative credit scoring methodologies. 
AdviceRobo credit scoring helps with a broad-based credit scoring mechanism beyond the traditional parameters employed by agencies and credit bureaus.
 AdviceRobo uses other tangible factors like, in the cooperation with ORIX, a psychometric profile to determine the creditworthiness of a new customer. 
AdviceRobo was founded in the Netherlands in 2015 and initially launched a psychographic credit scoring solution in the UK.
 Through collaboration with ORIX Credit, AdviceRobo explores the new possibilities of Japan's credit screening system. 
   We expect the experimental use of AdviceRobo's credit scoring for our loan card products to help perfect our credit knowhow and that the solution will offer the potential to expand our loans to many customers.  , comments Yoshinori Kimura, director at ORIX Credit Corporation. 
 As one of the most innovative global financial risk specialists, the potential offered by working with AdviceRobo looks perfect for me: In the digital era where consumers expect seamless access to loans and other financial services, this perfect combination will support the strong growth of ORIX Credit  , said AdviceRobo CEO Diederick van Thiel. 
 Accounting and consulting firm KPMG has taken a minority stake in AdviceRobo, a FinTech startup which its acquirer last year lauded as one of the globe’s 50 most promising FinTechs. 
 AdviceRobo, which is based in the Netherlands, provides a technology which helps banks and retail lenders with better predicting financial risk of people and companies taking out loans. 
 Rob Fijneman, Head of Advisory at KPMG in the Netherlands, describes AdviceRobo as a “frontrunner in the sector”, highlighting that the firm will bolster KPMG’s AI-based predictive behavioral services for lenders. 
AdviceRobo’s software applies AI on non-financial data including the behavior of potential borrowers.
 In addition, AdviceRobo’s algorithms can help with the identification of vulnerable consumers (those at risk of defaulting on loans in the future, churn and bad debt), providing lenders with more insight on risk-reward returns. 
 The Big Four has taken a minority interest in the FinTech startup, in a move that comes three quarters after KPMG in fact named AdviceRobo one of the globe’s most promising FinTechs. 
 KPMG’s list, created in collaboration with an investment firm, consists of two rankings: one list that identifies the globe’s 50 most renowned FinTech companies, and another which included AdviceRobo that zooms in on potential future disrupters. 
AdviceRobo CEO Diederick van Thiel said that the cooperation with “such a prominent player as KPMG” will accelerate the firm’s global growth trajectory.
 On top of the financial injection, AdviceRobo will be granted access to KPMG’S expertise in the fields of risk management, regulation and data and analytics, as well as its global network to support the firm’s expansion drive. 
 AdviceRobo currently serves its clients in ten countries across Europe and Latin America through offices in Amsterdam, London and Paris. 
 Among AdviceRobo’s client roster are Argenta and Visii in the Netherlands, OTP Group in Hungary, and Banco Macro in Argentina. 
 The partnership between KPMG and AdviceRobo is led by Erik Rood, a partner in KPMG’s Dutch Financial Services practice. 
Co-founder Van Thiel and Steenkamer will continue to head AdviceRobo.
 AdviceRobo has launched an open banking capability for lenders (Business Insider), Rated: A AdviceRobo focuses on offering credit risk management solutions, and its latest API product enables lenders to categorize transactional data and predict defaults to make sound credit decisions. 
 AdviceRobo empowers millennials and SMEs that are not served by traditional banks, by predicting creditworthiness, default, prepayments, churn and risk. 
AdviceRobo solutions make use of a machine learning platform that combines data from structured and unstructured sources to score and predict risk behavior of consumers.
 Inspired by the pandemic, a new program offered by an offshoot of food-and-beverage incubator Hatch is looking to help local restaurants land their wares on store shelves. 
Hatch’s Consumer Product Goods Bootcamp program is a 12-week crash-course in the skills restaurateurs need to create a packaged food product inspired by their menus.
 “Making something in the restaurant for service is different from scaling something up for the shelf,” Hatch President and co-founder Austin Green said. 
 It’s the first major program to come out of Hatch Helps, a budding nonprofit community outreach program under the Hatch banner, which also includes the commissary kitchen concept Hatch Kitchen in Clopton Siteworks on the Southside and the Hatch Local food hall that will open this summer in Manchester. 
 The program is free to participants, with Hatch Helps picking up the tab. 
 Karina Benavides, who co-owns Abuelita’s with husband Everardo Fonseca, said she had thought about getting into packaged goods prior to joining Hatch’s program but felt unsure how to navigate the process. 
Hatch is still working through exactly where the restaurants’ products will be sold.
 While Hatch Kitchen facilities are used to manufacture the products during the program, the participants are able to relocate their production if they choose once they’ve completed the courses. 
 Hatch publicly announced the program May 24, but it has been ongoing since the spring. 
 The Hatch mentorship network carries out the instruction, which has largely been one-on-one due to the pandemic. 
Hatch Helps launched in early 2020 as a community feeding program.
 The organization pays for ingredients, and Hatch members donate time to make food that’s distributed by the program. 
 Three BILCO Roof Hatch Models Approved For Hurricanes, Wind 
The BILCO Company now offers additional standard-sized roof hatches that are approved for hurricane and wind resistance by the Miami-Dade County Building Code Compliance Office and Florida Building Commission.
 Roof hatches provide safe and convenient access to roof areas by means of an interior ladder, ship stair, or service stair. 
 BILCO has added the 36”x36” (Type E), 48”X48” (Type F), and 30”x96” (Type L) standard size-size roof hatches to its line of specialty access products approved to withstand severe weather conditions, joining the company’s S and NB sizes which were previously offered. 
 The hatches are specifically designed and tested to withstand hurricanes and severe weather systems, and the new sizes offer more options for architects who are specifying roof hatches for projects located in hurricane zones. 
BILCO collaborated with the Miami-Dade County Building Code Compliance Office and Florida Building Commission to determine which Testing Application Standards would be required for roof hatches.
 To test the ability to endure high hurricane winds, the Uniform Static Air Pressure Test, per TAS 202, was first employed on the roof hatches. 
The hatches were placed in a test chamber and a 70 pound per square foot (PSF) uplift force was applied to the underside of the covers.
 Additionally, pressurized water, simulating wind-driven rain, was sprayed directly on the hatches for 15 minutes to assess their water-tightness in these demanding conditions. 
 At the end of these tests, BILCO hatches maintained their integrity as the covers remained closed and the full-perimeter gasketing ensured complete weather-tightness. 
BILCO hatches were also tested for the impact of wind-borne debris.
The test measured the damage and integrity of the roof hatch after impact.
The heavy-gauge construction of BILCO hatches withstood the impact and the heavy-duty slam latches ensured that the covers remained closed.
 This test, TAS 203, subjected the roof hatches to a 140 PSF force that alternated between uplift and downdraft and was applied for 671 cycles. 
The test measured the amount of deflection in the roof hatch covers and again examined the products’ integrity after testing.
 Hatch (elbow) resumed his rehab assignment at Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday, pitching two scoreless innings while allowing no hits and one walk in a 29-pitch start. 
 After opening the season on the 60-day injured list with an inflamed right elbow, Hatch began his rehab assignment at Buffalo on May 20 with a three-inning start. 
 According to Arden Zwelling of Sportsnet.ca, Hatch was omitted from Buffalo's pitching schedule for the next three weeks due to   mild tightness in his side,   but he's apparently overcome that issue. 
2022 Honda Civic Hatchback Teased Before June 23 Unveiling
 Valerie grew up in Richmond, where she raised her four children with her eternal companion Larry Hatch. 
Honda's redesigned 2022 Civic compact sedan unveiled in April will soon be joined by its hatchback sibling.
Honda late on Wednesday released a teaser photo of the redesigned 2022 Civic Hatchback and confirmed the reveal for June 23.
 As the teaser and our earlier spy shots confirm, the hatch has more of fastback profile than the traditional upright design. 
2022 Honda Civic Hatchback spy shots - Photo credit: S.
Honda hasn't said what powertrains will feature in the hatch but the sedan is currently being offered with a base 2.0-liter inline-4 rated at 158 hp and 138 lb-ft of torque and a spicier 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 rated at 180 hp and 177 lb-ft.
 The sedan is also being offered exclusively with a continuously variable transmission for now, though the hatch will add a 6-speed manual to the mix. 
We're glad to see Honda hasn't forgotten its hot hatch roots.
 Speaking of hot hatches, expect sporty Si and Type R versions of the hatch at some point. 
 While production of the sedan is being handled at a plant in Alliston, Canada, the hatch will be sourced from a plant in Greensburg, Indiana. 
It will be the first time a Civic Hatchback has been sourced from a U.S. plant.
Arguably it was not the advent of modern electric cars that undermined the allure of cars such as the M3 so much as the onset of some truly phenomenal hot hatches many years ago.
 More than that, it’s a car that can rightly claim the hot hatch crown from the VW Golf GTi. 
 Simply tasked with building a car that could win the hot hatch race, they proved their worth. 
 If you want that sweet mix of performance and refinement delivered by the hot hatch brigade, then the 128ti has all you need. 
Our verdict: BMW steals the hot-hatch crown.
 When then-President Bill Clinton signed The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) the week before Thanksgiving in 1993, it marked a remarkable bipartisan effort between Utah Republican Orrin Hatch and Massachusetts Democrat Ted Kennedy. 
 Religious freedom was sewn into the very fabric of this country from the beginning, and protecting the right of conscience for every American is essential to the future of our republic,” Hatch said in a press release from Becket. 
 Hatch was named the recipient more than a year ago, but the award presentation, typically presented at a gala dinner in New York City, was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic which shut down the country. 
Hatch’s work highlighted the annual event.
 “Specifically, we are both committed to religious freedom for all people,” he said, listing some of the reasons Hatch is deserving of the Canterbury honor. 
 “Orrin Hatch is a model of integrity, his public service always focused on what he considered best for the country not his personal agenda or personal ambitions,” he said. 
 He noted the unique gathering of people of faith, “called to be witnesses of hope,” and praised Hatch’s legacy of defending the Constitution. 
 Mark Rienzi, president of Becket, highlighted Hatch’s legislative accomplishments solidifying religious protections. 
 Hatch’s commitment to religious liberty, our freedom of conscience would simply not be what it is today,” he said in the release. 
 Wednesday, the Hatch Foundation in conjunction with Becket, held a religious liberty seminar highlighting some of the legal action by Becket in defense of religious liberty. 
 Matt Sandgren, Hatch Foundation executive director, summarized Hatch’s significant contributions in a single tweet: 
“Senator Hatch’s defense of religious liberty was animated by the belief that an attack on one religion is an attack on all — and it’s that very same belief that brings us together today.”
Such requirements are not unusual but it could give the government an escape hatch – if it wants one.
 Audi has published the first official preview images of its upcoming RS3 hot hatchback and saloon, suggesting a reveal is imminent. 
 Shown in camouflage as part of the wider Audi Sport line-up, the RS3 hatchback and RS3 Sportback are shown in production-ready guise, wearing a promotional wrap emblazoned with the sequence 1-2-4-5-3, likely a reference to the firing order of its five-cylinder powerplant. 
A Masked Lapwing extends one of its long legs as it hatches out in the hands of the new study's lead author.
But hatchlings of ground-nesting birds can neither flee nor defend themselves; their response in the face of danger is to hunker down and mute their cries.
It turns out that this innate behavior does not just begin on hatching.
Embryos of these birds typically emit embryonic calls—vocalizations from within the egg that occur in the last few days of incubation prior to hatching.
 To conduct the study, researchers spent many hours searching wetlands, saltmarshes, and fields for nests and waited until the eggs were within two to four days of hatching. 
 The first of those questions is why embryos call at all while still in the egg, when surely it would be safer to remain silent until they hatch. 
 More recently, a Spanish team studying Yellow-legged Gulls found that exposure to parental alarm calls during incubation affected chick growth and behavior on hatching, indicating that the acoustic environment can have profound effects on embryo development. 
 Kleindorfer says it is possible that they call to synchronize hatch date, which is particularly important in ground-nesting species since they are well-developed on hatching and leave the nest to forage independently very soon after. 
The new car’s faster steering and slightly firmer suspension also contribute to an involving hatch that represents one of the best driver’s cars in its class.
 Refined, engaging, and loaded with tech, the Volkswagen remains a class benchmark, but a soaring price and the waning relevance of hatchbacks will hamper sales. 
 That's changed in the model's latest generation, where this hot hatch has finally come into its own. 
 If you've never noticed, VW's performance hatchbacks are color-coded, with the GTI leaning heavily on red and the Golf R relying on blue. 
 The EPA has yet to release estimates for this new model, but for context, the previous one managed 23 mpg city and 30 mpg highway, which isn't bad for a powerful AWD hot hatch. 
 But then again, a Honda Civic Type R is nearly $39,000 these days, and the VW does feel more premium, so perhaps that's just what state-of-the-art hot hatchery costs nowadays. 
 For a guy raised on inexpensive hot hatches, that's still a tough pill to swallow, even though this new model won't be confused with a 1.8-liter Golf anymore. 
 Hatch (elbow) is scheduled to make his second rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo on Wednesday, Mike Harrington of The Buffalo News reports. 
Hatch will presumably get the green light to work deeper into Wednesday's outing after he was capped at three innings and 43 pitches in his 2021 debut May 20 versus Worcester.
Hatch will likely need one additional rehab start after Wednesday before Toronto decides whether he's fit to return from the 60-day injured list.
 “The solar panel array does two things, it collects solar in the summertime but it also has a bifacial system that collects off of the surface and patio space in the wintertime,” Jeff Hatch with Hatch Design and Architecture previously told the planning and zoning commission. 
 “It was our understanding that the concern had to do more about the safety and efficiency of solar panel products that they were familiar with, and less about the concern for height,” Hatch said.And working with planning staff there is an exception for that height in regards to antennas and other such ancillary structures to a building.” 
 “It was prudent to provide a minimum of two parking spaces for the development per apartment, the four apartments,” Hatch said.

 Leading Dutch subscription app Dyme has partnered with Tink for open banking technology, to take its money saving service across Europe. 
 Live in the Netherlands since November 2019, Dyme is now launching in the UK and Germany, to help people take greater control of their finances. 
 The partnership will see Dyme use Tink’s account aggregation technology in the UK and Germany, to connect people’s bank accounts within the app. 
 This enables Dyme to calculate which subscriptions or recurring costs users have, such as energy, mobile, insurance, or streaming services. 
Users can then decide whether they want to save money by letting Dyme re-negotiate or switch their service to a better deal or cancel their subscription in one click.
 People in the Netherlands have 14 subscriptions on average according to Dyme, who has already saved its Dutch users €3 million collectively. 
 Joran Iedema, founder of Dyme, said: “Many people have a blind spot when it comes to knowing exactly where their money goes every month, due to such rapid growth in the subscription economy. 
 Dyme has proven the service it offers to its users is valued, and we look forward to helping them take this to many more people across Europe.” 
Stefan Wesołowski and Michal Dyme serve as the music director and the cinematographer respectively.

 CHICAGO (WLS) -- Mother's Day is Sunday and one Chicago florist is busy filling three thousand orders, and every bouquet benefits a local charity.To say thank you for all their hard work and their commitment to giving back, ABC's Strahand and Sara surprised the owners of Flowers For Dreams with lunch from their favorite restaurant Nini's Deli.Steven Dyme and Jo Dickstein started their business when they were 19 years' old, selling flowers at graduation ceremonies.  For every bouquet we sell to a parents we would donate a backpack complete with school supplies to a student in need,   Dyme said.They continue that tradition by donating twenty five percent of their profits to local charities.  Now today we have donated nearly 500 thousand dollars just around half a million dollars to over 50 charities around the Chicagoland and Milwaukee area just on the sale of flowers,   Dickstein said.You can watch the entire lunch surprise here Strahan and Sara airs weekdays at 12 p.m. on ABC7. 
 The business posted the question on Sunday night, said co-founder and CEO Steven Dyme. 
 The hope is that the message will reinforce Flowers for Dreams' values of being inclusive and supporting people while rejecting ideals like Nazism or racial superiority, Dyme said. 
 It isn't controversial to reject Nazism or white supremacy, Dyme said, but some people feel like their more progressive views are   under attack.   
   People feel a little more vulnerable about their ideas ...   after the weekend's events, Dyme said. 
 Flowers for Dreams is dedicated to using its business to   advance causes we care about,   Dyme said. 
   Our customers tend to use their dollars to express their values,   Dyme said. 
It's a concept that Steven Dyme started in college with locations in Chicago and Milwaukee - and now Detroit.
   For every bouquet we sell, we donate to a local charity,   Dyme said. 
   Just under $600,000 donated to 100 charities all from the sale of flowers,   Dyme said. 
   People and Detroit are very invested in this Detroit Renaissance, they are invested in it,   Dyme said.

 Steven Dyme doesn't know, or understand, why sending a dozen roses is a staple of the flower delivery business. 
 Special events now comprise about half of the firm's revenues, Dyme said. 
 Dyme and his co-founder, Joe Dickstein, in no way intended to start a flower company. 
   It became a great hustle,   Dyme said. 
 After a few summers, Dyme and Dickstein became   the flower guys.   
Dyme said he didn't like any of the options he would recommend.
 But flowers come out of the ground, Dyme thought, and we should enjoy them more often. 
 Most of all, Dyme said, he wanted to deliver bouquets that came with an experience. 
 After graduating from college, Dyme and Dickstein started delivering the bouquets on bicycles in downtown Chicago with wooden crates strapped to their handlebars with bungee cords. 
   If we had done that math, we wouldn’t have started,   Dyme said. 
 In the Chicago warehouse, located in West Town, Dyme had four new break rooms built.

 Reynen Court, a company that aims to help law firms and in-house legal departments test and adopt cloud-based software applications, is growing its team soon after launching a new full-service offering. 
Reynen Court on Thursday said the company has brought on Sarah Glassmeyer as its legal tech curator.
 Glassmeyer joins Reynen Court from the American Bar Association, where she was counsel and a project specialist manager in its innovation center. 
   Sarah is a true legal innovator with a wealth of hands-on experience driving change across the legal landscape and a passion for reimagining how we describe, learn about, and organize legal technologies,   Christian Lang, Reynen Court's chief strategy officer, said in a statement. 
 The company said in the announcement that she will play a   lynchpin role in generating the content and strategy for the Solution Store, a central pillar of the Reynen Court platform.   
 Reynen Court's platform allows companies and firms to find, test, purchase and manage third-party software applications. 
 Reynen Court is one of several legal tech and legal services companies that have raised fresh funding from investors, law firms and others in the past year. 
Reynen Court in February also added Jae Um to its advisory board.
 The Thursday hire comes on the heels of Reynen Court's April 23 launch of a new full-service offering, which gives firms and legal departments   turn-key access   to a full solution without needing to manage their own private cloud, platform and technology deployment, the company said at the time. 
 Reynen Court said two other   sizable law firms   are slated to roll out the full-service offering during the second quarter of the year. 
   Like everyone in our industry, we see no end to the onslaught of new technologies,   Koch said,   and Reynen Court will allow us to cut through the noise so that we may rapidly adopt technologies that improve our efficiency and facilitate purposeful interactions with our clients.   
Reynen Court introduces secure cloud offering for law firms
 Reynen Court Inc., a fast-growing software company supported by a consortium of twenty of the largest global law firms, is launching a new full-service offering designed to accelerate innovation and expand adoption of its legal technology platform by law firms and in-house legal departments. 
 The Reynen Court platform helps firms and law departments efficiently source, test and buy, safely deploy, and strategically manage best-in-class software applications. 
 “Before we even launched to the very large law firms that helped us design the platform, innovation teams at several large and mid-sized firms started asking us whether we could provide these elements on a full-service basis,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew D. Klein. 
 In connection with the launch, Reynen Court and Womble Bond Dickinson, a firm of 1,100 lawyers in 26 offices across the U.S. and the U.K., jointly announced that the firm had signed up for the new model in order to speed up their sourcing, testing and acquiring of new cloud-based technologies. 
 Bridgewater saw former senior counsel Gary Beeson and deputy general counsel Sylvia Khatcherian, a board member at legal technology company Reynen Court LLC, leave its ranks last September. 
 In its version 2.0, Reynen Court is rolling out improvements to ensure the platform can consistently meet “the very high standards for security and resiliency required by large law firms,” according to a Thursday statement from the Amsterdam-based company. 
 Reynen Court, backed by a consortium of 19 leading U.S. and U.K.-based law firms, enables firms and corporate legal departments to streamline traditional tech procurement by providing an online store along with tools to test applications for functionality within the rest of their digital infrastructures. 
Reynen Court has attracted industry attention due to early and public buy-in and financial investment from prominent Big Law players.
 With this 2.0 release, “we are rounding first base with a full head of steam,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein in the statement. 
 Reynen Court confirmed in April that it had taken steps to cut costs, including 20% salary cuts for its senior executive team as well as freezes on new hiring and non-essential spending. 
Legaltech company Reynen Court has launched a new version of its app store platform that allows law firms and in-house teams to more easily access and manage third-party software applications without stressing their own IT infrastructure.
 Reynen Court’s new full-service platform adds to its existing self-managed platform, where users provide their own infrastructure to host the platform and manage all third-party applications in-house. 
 Venky Srinivasan, chief evangelist at Reynen Court and former chief technology officer at Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot, said: “For law firms and law departments that seek to access a portfolio of modern cloud-based solutions without having to trust their confidential data to a large and growing number of disparate [software-as-a-service] vendors, our full-service model will give them a powerful alternative to the self-managed platform.” 
 Bill Koch, chief knowledge officer at Womble Bond Dickinson in the US, said: “Like everyone in our industry, we see no end to the onslaught of new technologies, and Reynen Court will allow us to cut through the noise so that we may rapidly adopt technologies that improve our efficiency and facilitate purposeful interactions with our clients.” 
 Last October, Reynen Court secured $4.5m in further funding to accelerate its growth, adding to the $3m it raised in January 2020. 
Reynen Court backer Orrick earlier this month spun-out its first standalone business from its legaltech innovation hub Orrick Labs.
 DocsCorp, a leading provider of enterprise productivity solutions, announced today its participation in the Reynen Court Solutions Store. 
 By listing in Reynen Court’s Solutions Store, compareDocs has the potential to benefit law firms on a global scale. 
Reynen Court brings together the world’s largest law firms and over 100 of the most significant vendors to create a true marketplace for legal technology through its Solution Store.
 “Reynen Court is solving a significant problem in legal tech today, which is the time and effort it takes for law firms to source, test, and deploy new and innovative technologies. 
 Andrew Klein, Founder and CEO of Reynen Court, noted, “We are very pleased to add DocsCorp to our platform. 
 Japan’s largest law firm, Nishimura & Asahi, has become the latest firm to pour money into legal technology platform Reynen Court, the company said Monday. 
 MAIDENHEAD, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SDL (LSE: SDL), the intelligent language and content company, is pleased to announce its machine translation (MT) technology is now available through the Reynen Court LLC platform, enabling legal firms and departments to easily provision and deploy SDL Machine Translation to securely translate any type of legal document or file. 
 The Reynen Court platform combines a content-rich solution store and a powerful control panel that simplifies the process for law firms and legal departments to source, evaluate, deploy, monitor and manage legal technology applications. 
 “We regularly hear from our customers that machine translation is among their top investment priorities,” said Andy Klein, CEO of Reynen Court. 
That is why we are so excited to welcome SDL into the Reynen Court ecosystem.
 Reynen Court was established with support from a consortium of 19 leading global law firms, 13 of which currently work with SDL, and it only offers technology through its platform that meets robust security requirements. 
SDL’s secure machine translation technology conforms to Reynen Court’s stringent security protocols.
 “We’re delighted that SDL Machine Translation is the first language technology to feature on the Reynen Court platform,” said Christophe Djaouani, EVP, SDL. 
Reynen Court LLC (www.reynencourt.com) enables law firms and corporate legal departments to speed their adoption of AI and other new technologies.
 Founded by serial Internet entrepreneur and former Cravath, Swaine and Moore associate Andrew D. Klein, Reynen Court is supported by a broad consortium of nineteen of the largest global law firms. 
Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins serve as co-chairs of the Reynen Court consortium.
The legal tech “app store” Reynen Court has secured $3 million more in funding as the startup prepares for its official launch in the first quarter of this year.
 The funding includes new financing from Ventech, an early-stage venture capital fund, and from Prins H LLC, an investment vehicle controlled by Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein. 
 Reynen Court will allow attorneys at law firms and corporate legal departments the ability to browse scores of legal tech tools, including many powered by artificial intelligence. 
The funding comes as the Reynen Court platform enters its fifth month of live beta mode testing.
They include Reynen Court co-chair firms Latham & Watkins and Clifford Chance; vice chair Paul Weiss; White & Case; and Orrick.
Reynen Court was designed in significant part to accelerate the legal industry’s adoption of AI and other new technologies.
 Reynen Court received a boost last month when a unit of Big Four accountancy Deloitte, Deloitte Legal Ventures, included Reynen among a small group of startups they’ll be be working with to test and scale their platform. 
 Nishimura & Asahi, Japan’s largest law firm, has invested in Reynen Court, a curated “app store” allowing access to numerous legal-tech software applications via a secure platform. 
 Reynen Court’s platform allows Nishimura to run cloud-based applications in private clouds under the firm’s control, enabling testing and adoption of the latest legal technologies while maintaining security and stability, and also localising global legal-tech products for the Japan and Asia markets. 
 Officially launched in 2018, Reynen Court announced in October that it had secured $4.5 million in funding from investors as Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins. 
 The legal tech “app store” Reynen Court has announced its official launch, as the platform continues to gain new backing from Big Law firms. 
 Since Reynen Court’s 2018 founding, the group has enlisted 19 prominent firms to join its consortium, and has gained a total of more than $10 million in investments. 
 Since the ILTA Conference a few weeks ago, I’ve been hearing and reading about Reynen Court. 
 What’s unique about Reynen Court, however, is the automation and interoperability the platform offers. 
 Reynen Court recently launched a beta version of its platform, which is intended to help legal operations teams in corporate and at law firms gain fast access to software applications without worrying about the time, cost, and hassle of on-premise implementation, expensive infrastructure, or concerns about cloud security. 
 What’s makes Reynen Court useful is it enables subscribers to find and buy software, manage computing power and user access, and it provides metrics that aid in monitoring usage and expenditures. 
 Currently, there are more than 50 applications available in the Reynen Court platform, and they are continuously adding more. 
Does this mean that legal departments and law firms will soon be able to subscribe to popular solutions like Relativity via Reynen Court?
 CEO Andy Klein, a former Cravath attorney turned brewery owner and asset manager who founded Reynen Court in 2017 on the premise that he wanted to accelerate adoption of legal technology, believes there is plenty of room in the legal tech space for large SaaS providers; Reynen Court will be available for those organizations who cannot or choose not to make that investment. 
 With Reynen Court, software offerings in the platform can be deployed almost instantly, even on a Friday at 5 p.m. when a transactional team realizes they need to dig into some documents as part of a due diligence effort. 
Lang says that Reynen Court is working to develop a tiered pricing model that scales based on usage.
 Another source of revenue comes from the software companies that make their products available for deployment through the platform, which pay a fee to Reynen Court. 
 Additionally, if a software company chooses to sell their product through the Reynen platform, there’s a revenue share with Reynen Court. 
 In fact, there’s an advantage to using Reynen Court for medium to small organizations and firms — those who do not have the infrastructure or resources to run a full suite of technology tools. 
 For smaller companies with small legal departments or smaller firms that have big clients, Reynen Court could really level the playing field and give them access to the same tools as the largest firms. 
Reynen Court is hoping to have a full commercial release in the first quarter of 2020.
 Reynen Court has announced an investment from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, its third from a prominent law firm as the legal technology “app store” nears a commercial launch. 
 While the exact amount of Orrick’s investment hasn’t been released, it is less than the $2.1 million that Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins, co-chairs of 19-firm consortium, each made in December of 2018, Reynen Court founder and CEO Andy Klein told Bloomberg Law. 
 “The Reynen Court platform simplifies these steps, accelerating our clients’ ability to leverage new technology—which is a win for all of us.” 
 The next step, he said, will be to launch a version of the app that’s available to firms and law departments that enter licensing agreements with Reynen Court. 
Klein has said Reynen Court will earn revenue from the fixed-fee annual licensing agreements and from firms’ software purchases through the “app store” itself.
 At the same time, legal tech “app store” Reynen Court, which has been backed by a consortium of 19 leading U.S. and U.K.-based law firms, has taken several steps to cut costs over recent weeks, said the startup’s founder and CEO, Andy Klein. 
 Unlike Reynen Court, Elevate has not put a hiring freeze in place, Brown said. 
 According to Klein, none of the 19 firms that are part of Reynen Court’s consortium have backed off their commitment to the company, which officially launched in late January after running a six-month beta test. 
 All three of these marketplace debuts follow the formal launch last January of Reynen Court, the platform that has been dubbed the app store of law — and in which the aforementioned Orrick is a principal investor, along with global firms Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins — and come as Reynen on October 28 announced an additional $4.5 million in funding (and said just today that Japan’s largest firm has invested in the company). 
Reynen Court’s mission is to make it easier for law firms and legal departments to adopt and manage modern cloud-based software applications without having to trust firm or client content to the rapidly growing universe of vertically integrated SaaS providers.
 Notably, Reynen Court recently launched a new functionality called Test Drive, which founder and CEO Andrew Klein recently demonstrated for me. 
 And, here, three is nowhere near a crowd (or four, factoring in Reynen Court). 
 Where Legaltech Hub and Orrick Observatory aim to be comprehensive catalogs, the TR Marketplace and Reynen Court focus on making it easier to test products in advance and then more seamlessly deploy them. 
 (By the way, if you’d like to learn more, listen to my LawNext podcast episodes with Nicola Shaver, recorded just after ILTA named here Innovative Leader of the Year, and Reynen Court founder Andrew Klein.) 
 “The value law firms bring to the table beyond the money is their real understanding about the problem that you’re building your company to address,” said Andrew Klein, founder of the “app store for legal tech” Reynen Court, which has secured funding from Clifford Chance, Latham & Watkins and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe in recent years, including a $4.5 million investment round announced in late October. 
 Bridgewater Associates’ deputy general counsel has signed on to the board of growing legal tech company Reynen Court, which will function as a legal tech app store and is already backed by a group of major law firms. 
 Reynen Court is primed to help law firms and corporate legal departments take advantage of a fast-growing legal tech market, which topped $400 million in funding to legal tech vendors in the first quarter of 2019, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis. 
The Reynen Court app will allow lawyers to purchase legal tech vendor programs and download them onto their phones and work laptops in secure “cloud” environments.
 “Sylvia will guide us as we build support for moving law firm and client content out of traditional on-premise data centers and into firm controlled but third-party hosted virtual private clouds,” said Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew Klein in a statement. 
 Reynen Court’s website lists 55 legal tech vendor programs that law firms using the platform will be able to choose from, including nine that tout the use of artificial intelligence. 
 “By accelerating the adoption of legal technology, they have the potential to truly transform the legal industry for the benefit of law firms, their clients and society,” Khatcherian said of Reynen Court in the statement. 
 Reynen Court’s five-member board also includes Tom Glocer, co-founder of BlueVoyant, a cyber security defense and APT monitoring company; Marcel Van Lohuizen, a longtime software engineer who has worked for Google since 2002; and Paul Greenwood and Ken Heaps, respectively the chief information officers for Clifford Chance and Latham & Watkins. 
 Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe’s investment arm participated in a funding round that raised $6.3 million for legal talent marketplace Priori Legal, while Latham & Watkins and Clifford Chance took part in a funding round for tech platform Reynen Court that secured $4.5 million. 
 Unlike Reynen Court, Orrick noted it doesn’t sell any software on its platform. 
And Reynen Court – which has created an app store for legaltech – also raised $4.5m of funding last October to accelerate its growth plans.
 Last year, Orrick launched an internal legal tech social network to help lawyers understand new digital tools, and in January, the firm invested in Reynen Court, a legal technology “app store” aimed at law firms and corporate legal departments. 
 They include legal tech “app store” Reynen Court, which has enlisted 18 Big Law firms as backers, the law firm time-keeping startup Ping, and contract automation platform Avvoka. 
 These include Reynen Court, which represents several of the world’s biggest law firms; LexFusion, which curates best of breed products for firms and legal departments; PartnerVine, a portal for buying and selling legal products; and several vendor app stores, whereby legal tech’s big providers give their customers quick access to partner products and services, and other tools and applications that add on to or integrate with their platforms. 
 Meanwhile, the curated app platform with big-name backers, Reynen Court, has been given an extra $3m. 
 Reynen Court, the platform aimed at simplifying the adoption of advanced legal technology has secured $3m of additional funding from an investment vehicle controlled by Reynen Court founder and CEO Andrew D Klein, and Ventech, a global early-stage venture capital fund 
 Requiring masks unless all are vaccinated in a workplace would “create yet another barrier to rehiring and reopening” at a time when “we need to be providing incentives to bring people back,” they said. 
Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology
 A latter-day concern with environmental stocktaking is at the heart of Kiel Moe’s latest book, Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology. 
 Unless identifies and maps out this web, revealing to readers how a singular modernist building was not simply the result of singular design talents but rather physical, economic, and environmental processes spanning different times and multiple geographies. 
 Be that as it may, Unless expands on previous Seagram literature, from Lambert’s searching and analytical Building Seagram (2013) and her sweeping edited volume Mies in America (2001) to the eclectic and interpretive The Presence of Mies (1994), edited by the late Detlef Mertins—an impressive body of work, to be sure, one signaling allegiances to art and architectural history with ease and panache. 
 But with Unless, Moe aims for something more expansive. 
 And yet the most enterprising readers may notice that he does not mention other contemporary scholars like Paul Edwards, Timothy Morton, or Jane Bennett, whose important work on the very issues of scale and ecology that drive Unless could comprise their own “novel theoretical framework.” 
 And yet, Unless is at its best when it is entirely and unapologetically conventional. 
Unless certainly makes for a unique reading experience.
 Holding Unless, the synecdochic relationship between book and building becomes clear. 
 Taking into account his desire to introduce architects to new, otherwise unfamiliar books and authors, some analytical and narrative drift is to be expected, and there is no doubt that Unless will resonate with architectural audiences wanting to know about the larger social, material, and analytical contexts for the Seagram Building. 
 “Forcible separation” is a loaded term, and yet it captures something evident throughout the pages of Unless: The Seagram Building Construction Ecology.

NNNCo has teamed up with Dutch manufacturer of wireless soil moisture sensors Sensoterra to bring its products to the Asia Pacific.
Sensoterra’s LoRaWAN soil moisture probes are available on the LoRAWAN AS923 band (923MHZ) enabling the devices to work on LoRaWAN networks across Australia and Asia Pacific.
An NNNCo spokesperson told IoTAustralia the company had funded stock of the probes jointly with Sensoterra for distribution in Australia.
 Sensoterra’s commercial director, Bas Van Der Velden, said NNNCo would provide local warehouseing for the company’s products. 
 Now, Kerlink, a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), and Sensoterra, a specialist in wireless soil-moisture-sensor solutions, have announced a partnership to take care of water waste. 
Sensoterra has been working with growers since its founding in 2014 to bring smart soil-moisture solutions to the market.
Sensoterra’s current line of probes can measure soil-moisture down to almost a meter deep and the associated software allows users to zoom into conditions around individual probes.
 “Less than 2% of agricultural land worldwide is equipped for soil-moisture measurement, which presents a very large market for wireless soil-monitoring and a big opportunity to improve water conservation,” said Christine Fraser-Boer, chief operating officer at Sensoterra. 
 Using Kerlink’s LoRaWAN-based Low Power IoT Reference Design platform to produce a new class of soil-moisture sensors, Sensoterra will launch its new sensors in the U.S., Europe, and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region beginning this year. 
 Accurate measurement of soil moisture is obviously key but, according to Jonathan Wisler (Sensoterra), developing world agriculture is still in the early stages of integrating soil moisture sensors into irrigation systems at scale. 
 Sensoterra offers a soil moisture data platform that can be calibrated to soil type and integrated with other tools to combine data from weather forecasts, temperature and other readings, allowing growers to make ‘educated’ irrigation timing decisions. 
 Wisler at Sensoterra believes growers will need fewer soil sensors in future and that it will be possible to estimate soil moisture “by using historical data about water penetration in your crop as well as soil type, combined with information from your irrigation controllers”. 
 Semtech, Sensoterra and Senet highlighted precision agriculture solutions that require technologies that can withstand the elements, function reliably, operate for long periods of time without requiring changes in batteries, and deliver economic returns to commercial farmers, which has not been easy in the past. 
 Scale is where Semtech, Sensoterra and Senet seem to be going. 
 “Since announcing our partnership over a year ago, Sensoterra has proven the value of Semtech’s LoRa Technology and how low-cost, long-range LoRaWAN-based connectivity can deliver to the agriculture market,” said Bruce Chatterley, CEO at Senet. 
“We look forward to building on these successes as both Sensoterra and Senet expand our solution deployments and connectivity offerings globally.”
 “As water becomes more scarce in many parts of the world, Sensoterra’s LoRa-based solutions allow farmers to manage their irrigation systems more efficiently,” said Jurriaan Ruys, CEO of Sensoterra. 
 Sensoterra is a low-cost, wireless and remote system that offers farmers real-time insight into the soil moisture condition of their crops. 
 Sensoterra primarily focuses on the North American and European agriculture markets and has deployed over 4,000 sensors and achieved 720,000 data points to date. 
 Sensoterra’s solutions are now being deployed in Australia, South America and other parts of the world. 
 Farmers can get real-time insight into the conditions of their crops soil with Sensoterra – an affordable, wireless, Internet of Things (IoT) method to monitor moisture levels remotely. 
 Recently, Senet and Sensoterra BV announced a multiyear partnership in which Sensoterra’s soil-moisture system will operate on Senet’s standards-based Low Power Wide Area Network. 
 Sensoterra’s sensors are rugged, self-sustaining, low cost, and wireless, which allows them to operate on a wireless network infrastructure in demanding conditions. 
 Only these characteristics will allow growers to scale their deployments and benefit from true operational visibility,” says Jurriaan Ruys, CEO of Sensoterra. 
 “Better radio technology for connectivity and the very low price for which we can offer the sensor are key drivers that have allowed sensor technology to reach agriculture,” says Bas van der Velden, sales director for Sensoterra. 
 In May 2020, SensoTerra, for example, began new wireless systems to enhance agricultural networking and cloud field data analysis. 
 In a commercial potato farm, farmers utilized Sensoterra’s LoRa-based soil irrigation sensor to reduce water usage by 30%. 
SUMMER VAMP: Model goes from 'Dragon Girl' to 'vampire'
 Try refreshing your browser, or SUMMER VAMP: Model goes from 'Dragon Girl' to 'vampire' Back to video 
 In her recent post, captioned “vampire vibes,” she details that she had “two canines permanently sharpened” and is “stoked” by the results. 
 The former Transvision Vamp frontwoman had been due to tour on its release last May. Now on its third rescheduling, the tour should – everything crossed – take place this autumn. 
 The former Transvision Vamp singer, Wendy James has released four solo albums 
 At the start of her career, Wendy was happy to sing the words of others – she started Transvision Vamp with guitarist Nick Christian Sayer, who was also the band's principle songwriter. 
 He was 10 years older than me and had been in bands and had written songs, but he didn't have that drive, so when you put the two of us together, that's what propelled Transvision Vamp forward. 
 After their record label refused to release Transvision Vamp’s third album in the UK, the band folded in 1992. 
 It's not my favourite piece of work that I've ever done, but it certainly gave me a way, without it being too traumatic, to put Transvision Vamp in the rearview and set me on a path to the future. 
 ‘I'm writing album 10,’ there’s been three with Transvision Vamp, two fronting the band Racine, and four solo, ‘and then in August, I'll decamp to London to begin rehearsals for this tour. 
 The idea came about after joining one of Tim Burgess’s Twitter listening parties, for the Transvision Vamp album, Velveteen. 
 ‘It got me thinking, there's so many good songs that haven't necessarily been hits, but for those that know my music, there's so many good cuts on all of my albums post-Transvision Vamp, that there's no reason why I should stick to one setlist.

 This is the story shared by Rodriguez Chavez and selected for VAMP, a storytelling showcase created by community arts organization So Say We All San Diego, which provides opportunities for people to tell their stories. 
The most surprising part about VAMP for Rodriguez Chavez was the profound impact sharing her story and hearing others’ stories had on her as a human being.
 This experience, never spoken of in her family again after the day it happened, was something Watson struggled with in silence until VAMP. 
It was through her VAMP writing and performance that she found a part of her voice that she’s been repressing.
 One of the most powerful things about VAMP, Willie said, was publicly taking ownership of her story. 
 VAMP, Visual Audio Monologue Performance, is taught in many City College English classes where all students are encouraged to submit work for the opportunity to perform in front of a virtual audience. 
 The spring VAMP theme “Wake Up” inspired performers to explore their world through words, vividly chronicling loss of innocence, family, culture and language. 
 Bringing a bizarre underworld to life, Richard Wenk’s Vamp takes inspiration from these films’ bubbling ambience and throws in a dose of From Dusk Till Dawn for good measure to create a cocktail of surrealism brought to life by Grace Jones. 
 Illustrating a coming-of-age naivety, Wenk’s film follows two fraternity pledges sprawling the streets searching for a stripper, only to stumble into a sleazy bar occupied by vampires. 
 Who better to lead the clutch of vampires than the iconic eccentric Grace Jones as Katrina, an uncanny figure covered in white paint, turquoise contact lenses and a large red bobbed wig. 
 Vamp typifies the cultural stature of Grace Jones, a champion of pop, fashion, cinema and the LGBTQ+ community.

 Not long after they've busted down a barrier and passed through a prohibited section, they get preyed upon by a feral vampire covered head-to-toe in animal pelts. 
 With rudimentary language skills and a homemade clay doll, the foundling is able to communicate that the feral vampire is her father. 
 Jack cuts her hand to bait the vampire out with her blood, but he quickly swats Jack away, and breaks Ivory's arms, rendering her powerless. 
 Jack goes hand-to-hand with the feral long enough for Jack to regain consciousness, jump on the vampire, and turn him. 
 You never know when a mine shaft is going to open beneath your feet, or a boulder is going to drop on your head, or a feral vampire is going to skin you alive.

 Leading on from their epic collaboration, ‘All The Lies’, that eclipsed over 100 million Spotify streams and Top 10 airplay across the globe, ALOK and The Vamps reunite once again with family duo BLOODLINE for the stirring, emotive ‘Another You’. 
 As a merger that crosses a multitude of genres, from ALOK’s deeper dance soundscapes, over to the vocals of The Vamps that stir and fortify the release with a rapturous element, BLOODLINE brings in their trademark elements of raw-meets-rock-influenced atmospherics that intertwine, as one, with a slick finish. 
 ‘Another You’ comes at a time for the collective trio of acts when their careers and accolades speak for themselves; take ALOK, South America’s biggest dance artist that recently surpassed 3 billion solo artist streams, over to The Vamps also skyrocketing to 4 billion streams respectively, becoming the first band to headline London’s epic o2 Arena five years in a row as one of the largest UK pop acts in recent memory. 
 By working with Land Life Company, Achmea wants to achieve its own climate objectives but also help customers reduce CO2 emissions until true carbon neutrality can be achieved.

The Achmea Innovation Fund believes in the mission of Land Life Company.
The investment by the Achmea Innovation Fund and its co-investors will ensure that Land Life Company can enter its next growth phase.
 As well as investing, Achmea Innovation Fund specifically wants to build a long-term alliance with Land Life Company. 
 In that context, Katharina Maass of the Achmea Innovation Fund joins the Supervisory Board of Land Life Company as of closing of the transaction. 
 Jurriaan Ruys, CEO of Land Life Company on the investment and alliance:   Land Life Company looks forward to extending the partnership with the Achmea Innovation Fund. 
Both Achmea and Land Life Company have a social heart and see what can be achieved with new technology.
ABN AMRO Clearing and Land Life Company will kick off a five-year reforestation program this summer that includes large-scale tree plantings across the globe.
 The five-year, multi-geography climate action program builds further on the current two-year climate action plan between ABN AMRO Clearing and Land Life Company. 
 “ABN AMRO Clearing has always looked beyond carbon in their climate action program,” says Rebekah Braswell, CCO of Land Life Company. 
 From its base in Amsterdam, Land Life Company works to restore lands degraded by natural or human activities such as wildfire, desertification, agriculture and urbanization. 
 Europe’s leading online fashion platform retailer Zalando and Land Life Company, a tech-driven reforestation company, have teamed up to plant over 300,000 trees to capture 80,000 tons of CO2. 
 Rebekah Braswell, Land Life Company CCO, said: “This collaboration is so exciting as it extends the consumer sustainability experience from the purchase to delivery to fundamental questions about what type of consumers we want to be. 
 With Land Life Company, we have found a partner who shares our vision and provides technological solutions to regenerate land. 
Rebekah Braswell is founding member and CCO of Amsterdam-based impact enterprise Land Life Company.
 Land Life Company has been attracting corporations, NGOs and governmental organizations as clients – all of them interested in reducing their carbon footprint through the offset provided by their reforestation and land degradation recovery projects. 
 At Land Life Company, we leverage pioneering technologies to plant trees at scale and maximize the impact of our reforestation efforts. 
Which personal experiences contributed to that eureka moment when you realized that Land Life Company would survive as a company and that you could achieve your bold goals?
What has been the most challenging project by Land Life Company so far?
 From its base in Amsterdam, Land Life Company works to restore lands degraded by natural or human activities such as wildfire, desertification, agriculture and urbanization. 
 A few weeks ago I received a press release from Land Life Company in my mailbox with the following news: ‘In 2020, the Dutch company will go and plant around three million trees and restore an estimated three thousand hectares of wasteland.’ 
Now it’s time to put Land Life Company itself in the spotlight.
 By doing so, Land Life Company is selling its ‘services’ to third parties. 
Ruys sees Land Life Company as a pioneer in what he calls “a new Oklahoma Land Rush.”
 Planting trees has been done for centuries, but Ruys maintains that Land Life Company does it in a sustainable way. 
Land Life Company's mission is to restore the world’s 2 billion hectares of degraded land.
 When Jurriaan Ruys (former McKinsey Partner and Eneco COO) and Eduard Zanen (founder Bugaboo) launched Land Life Company in 2013, they set out to develop and implement new technologies to sustainably restore those parts of the world where nature cannot come back unaided. 
And among them is Dutch start-up the Land Life Company.
 Globally, 2 billion hectares of land is degraded, according to Land Life Company co-founder and CEO Jurriaan Ruys – that’s an area the size of the United States and China combined. 
 Electrification of the company’s main assets will result in over 95 percent of oil and gas production being powered by electricity from shore by 2023, according to Lundin Energy, which highlighted that the company has also entered into a partnership with Land Life Company BV to plant approximately eight million trees. 
 Land Restoration Key Players : Natural Texas, Land Restoration, Adaptive Restoration LLC, Land Life Company Sanderson Environmental, Neiman Environments, Inc., Agrecol LLC, Applied Ecological Services (AES), Angie’s List, and WinterCreek Restoration & Nursery. 
Land Life Company has developed technology to help reforest degraded land across the world and tackle the carbon emissions crisis.

 The region’s arid climate and depleted soils would be a recipe for disaster in your average reforestation program, but for the Amsterdam-based Land Life Company it’s an ideal place. 
 asks Arnout Asjes, Land Life Company’s chief technology officer, who oversees a mix of drone and satellite imagery, big data analysis, soil enhancement, QR tagging and site-specific tree configuration designs. 
One innovation that is helping increase seedling survival rates is Amsterdam-based Land Life Company’s ‘Cocoon.’
 By teaming up with L’Oréal to support a new partnership between the Arbor Day Foundation the Land Life Company, we can make a difference in this critical ecosystem. 
 Through the project, Land Life Company is working alongside CONAFOR (Mexican Ministry of Forestry), CONANP (Ministry of Protected Natural Areas) and the World Wildlife Fund to restore degraded forestland, protecting the Monarch’s habitat for generations to come. 
 Land Life Company, founded by an ex-Shell engineer, patented a product that enables trees to grow in dry and degraded land. 
 In a bid to give the saplings a better chance at taking root, UNHCR and FNC, in partnership with Innovation Norway, a development agency of the Norwegian government, and the Dutch Land Life Company, are experimenting with growing them in cocoons in the tree nursery where Nyakong works. 
 One example of a company that has had success in Cameroon is Land Life Company, which sells seedling kits in the form of circular pods that are buried in the ground and specialize in arid soils: 
 To help investor and entrepreneurs gain insight from real-world examples of companies, the report profiles the following 14 businesses: BioCarbon Engineering, Brinkman, EcoPlanet Bamboo, Ecosia, F3 Life, Fresh Coast Capital, Guayaki, Komaza, Land Life Company, Lyme Timber, New Forests, Symbiosis Investimentos, Tentree, and Terviva. 
 Fresh Coast Capital recently raised $1.25 million in a grant and investment from the Kresge Foundation, and Land Life Company, the startup with the paper “cocoon” for planting trees, is in the middle of an investment round. 
 Land Life Company – Based in Amsterdam, Land Life Company is all about trees, specializing in giving life back to degraded land, and offering full reforestation services. 
Offsetting residual and hard to abate emissions will cost Lundin Energy USD 35 million between 2021 and 2025 as it plants around eight million trees in partnership with Amsterdam-based Land Life Company BV.
 As part of its reforestation project, Zalando plans to plant well over 300,000 trees in Spain by the end of 2022 together with the Land Life Company. 
 “At Land Life Company, we believe there is no greater tool than a tree to remove carbon from the atmosphere, revitalize nature and tackle climate change. 
 By planting thousands of hectares of forest, we are able to remove significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while boosting biodiversity and rebuilding habitats at the same time”, explains Rebekah Braswell, COO of Land Life Company. 
 Across 40 acres, partners to save the Monarch — including Arbor Day Foundation, L’Oreal, International Paper, Land Life Company reforestation experts, Mexican Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Protected Natural Areas and the World Wildlife Fund — have teamed together to plant 21,666 trees. 
 For example, start-up companies like MicroGen Biotech in Ireland, Land Life Company in The Netherlands and Trace Genomics in the U.S. are exploring a combination of digital technologies with microbiome/genomic platforms for evaluating and initiating soil health programmes. 
 The Amsterdam-based B2B SaaS firm SwipeGuide has raised €5 million in a round led by Speedinvest and supported by CapitalT, and Plug & Play Ventures, as well as existing investors Newion and Brumbucks. 
 As part of the funding, Speedinvest’s Marie-Hélène Ametsreiter and CapitalT’s Janneke Niessen will join the board at SwipeGuide.

 LONDON, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Wercker, the Docker-native developer automation platform, has today launched Virtual Private Pipelines (VPP), a paid SaaS offering aimed at helping application development teams move faster. 
 Wayne Gibbins, Chief Commercial Officer at Wercker, said,   We're excited to launch VPP, wrapping up our previous product iterations and customer trials over the past two years into one solution, delivering the tooling and experience that modern developer teams sorely need. 
 Wercker is the automation glue in the cloud-native movement, marked by the convergence of microservices, Docker and container orchestration.   
 Developers using Wercker can deploy to all major cloud providers, and the platform is compatible with all container orchestration tools. 
 In particular, Wercker is optimised for teams deploying to Kubernetes, Google's production-grade container orchestration tool, which is also used by Wercker. 
 The Wercker platform consists of a SaaS interface as well as a Command Line Interface (CLI), which the company open-sourced in January 2016. 
 Wercker also provides extensibility through its API and open marketplace, where users can create and share custom automation workflows. 
Wercker supports a microservice architecture with features like API contract testing with the ability to spin up multiple services within Docker containers for pre-deployment testing between services.
Wercker is an ideal solution for cutting-edge development teams within companies of all sizes.
 David Aronchick, Kubernetes Product Manager at Google, added,   Both Kubernetes and Wercker strive to make containers simple and powerful. 
 We're excited to see how Wercker can supercharge development with automation pipelines to build and test containers that deploy to Kubernetes.   
Wercker also recently relaunched its website with enhanced content and tutorials for Kubernetes and leading cloud vendors.
 Wercker's Virtual Private Pipelines executes automation workloads on a fully managed, network-isolated stack. 
 The single tenancy nature of the system ensures organisations don't queue outside of their own organisation, can scale within seconds and have support and advice from the Wercker solutions team. 
 Wercker is designed to integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes, allowing developers to move faster and do more. 
 Wercker is a container-centric automation platform used to develop, build, test and deploy cloud-native applications. 
 Wercker was founded in 2011 and has offices in San Francisco, London and Amsterdam. 
 Wercker is used by organisations deploying software applications to the cloud, fully supports microservices, is Docker-native and optimised for schedulers like Kubernetes. 
 Wercker is led by executive team Micha Hernandez van Leuffen (CEO), Andy Smith (CTO) and Wayne Gibbins (CCO) and has raised $7.9 million in venture capital funding. 
 Database technology giant Oracle has announced plans to acquire Wercker, a Dutch startup that offers tools for automating the process of testing and deploying code. 
 Founded out of Amsterdam in 2012, Wercker offers developers a container-centric platform that helps automate the development of applications and microservices. 
 It operates in a space that includes competitors such as Shippable, Codeship, CircleCI, Drone.io, and Semaphore, though Wercker cites its ability to integrate with Docker containers as one differentiator. 
 Wercker had raised around $8 million since its inception, including a $4.5 million round last year. 
 As for its plans for Wercker, Oracle says that together they will “democratize developer tooling for the modern cloud.” 
Oracle and Wercker share the view that developers greatly benefit from focusing on building great products and applications.
 A leading cloud needs great tooling and adding Wercker’s container lifecycle management to Oracle’s Cloud provides engineering teams with the developer experience they deserve to build, launch and scale their applications. 
 A separate FAQ document states that Wercker will be integrated into Oracle’s existing developer-focused tools and services once the transaction closes, with Oracle noting that Wercker customers will “benefit from better integration and alignment with Oracle’s other product offerings.” 
Oracle has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the continuous integration platform provider Wercker.
Wercker enables organizations and development teams to reach CI and continuous delivery goals with microservices and Docker with its container-centric and cloud-native automation platform.
 According to Oracle, with Wercker the company can continue its mission of democratizing developer tooling for the modern cloud. 
 “Wercker greatly enhances the Oracle portfolio with a compelling Docker-based automation product and will accelerate the productivity of developers, across the entire spectrum, from the enterprise to the open source community.” 
 The two companies are Moat, a digital measurement cloud company and Wercker who provide a container-centric and cloud-native automation platform. 
Nor will it close down the GitHub account access to Wercker.
Oracle is looking to invest in developing the Wercker platform and integrating it into the Oracle Cloud.
In the short term it appears as though it is business as usual for Wercker customers.
 In a blog by Micha Hernandez van Leuffen, Founder and CEO, Wercker he wrote: “In the near term, our team, free community edition, and relentless focus on the developer experience remain unchanged.” 
He is positive about the impact of the acquisition though seeing it as a way to reach out to a wider community of developers and bring the Wercker solution to the hyper scale that Oracle can provide.
 Wercker greatly enhances the Oracle portfolio with a compelling Docker-based automation product and will accelerate the productivity of developers, across the entire spectrum, from the enterprise to the open source community.” 
Wercker has raised around $7.9 million in three funding rounds according to Crunchbase.
 Wercker is smaller, but brings some developer tools that the Oracle community should welcome. 
 According to Crunchbase, Oracle has agreed to buy three other companies in 2017 so far: API design platform Apiary, developer tools startup Wercker and Moat, which measures ad engagement. 
 The former startup Wercker is now part of Oracle, which calls the acquired CI/CD product by the simple but very useful name of Oracle Container Pipelines. 
 OKE cluster can also be integrated with Wercker, the Docker-based continuous delivery platform, which fastens up the process of building and deploying new applications and microservices. 
 In April, database technology giant Oracle snapped up Wercker, a Dutch startup that helps automate code testing and deployment. 
 As for Oracle’s plans, it said that the duo would “democratize developer tooling for the modern cloud,” which effectively means Wercker’s technology will be integrated into Oracle’s existing developer-focused tools and services. 
 Rockstart has notable exits such as Wercker, Bouw7, and iClinic. 
 With its focus on continuous integration, Swarm will also face CircleCi, Jenkins, Wercker, CloudBees and CloudMunch in a developer market that continues to grow. 
 Other similar deals in the past have been VMware’s acquisitions of Pivotal and Heptio, Oracle buying Wercker, and Red Hat acquiring CoreOS. 
 The Container Engine service can be used separately or in conjunction with a tweaked version of the open source Docker container registry service, which Oracle has tweaked to integrate with its various bits of middleware and systems software on its cloud, and a new continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) development environment, called Container Pipelines, which is based on the tools that came to the company through its acquisition of Wercker earlier this year. 
 With the combination of Kubernetes, Wercker, and Docker Registry, the Oracle Cloud has a next-gen application development and deployment platform akin to Red Hat OpenShift or VMware Cloud Foundry. 
 But with the combination of Oracle Linux with Kubernetes and Wercker and hooking into the Container Registry Service, enterprise customers that want the same stack internally as well as externally should be able to get that experience, more or less. 
(Related: Wercker releases Docker pipelines-management platform)
 Wercker, a “cloud-based continuous delivery platform for cloud software development” likes to wreck stuff. 
 Wercker’s solution enables developers to push software updates incrementally as they are ready, rather than in bundled dumps. 
Wercker is still in private beta.
 It was part of the 2012 Rockstart Accelerator startup incbuator program in Amsterdam, where Wercker is based. 
 Toon Verbeek, developer evangelist for Wercker, used Keen IO analytics to graph the pass/fail rate of Wercker's development team. 
 We’ve been home to notable members FreeUp (acquired by Greensill), Divide (acquired by Google), Bloomsbury AI (acquired by Facebook), JukeDeck (acquired by TikTok), Yammer (acquired by Microsoft), Nexmo (acquired by Vonage), Wercker (acquired by Oracle), EyeTease, Callsign, SwiftKey, and Babylon Health. 
 Now, many of those startups have become hugely successful independent companies (such as Slack) or have been acquired (such as Wercker or Electric Cloud) by larger organizations. 
 Moat joins a swathe of new acquisitions by Oracle in recent years, including Dutch code deployment startup Wercker and API development startup Apiary. 
Company Acquired Company Purpose Date Acquired Amount Red Hat Codenvy container development team workspaces 5/25/2017 Undisclosed Oracle Wercker operate and deploy cloud native apps at scale 4/17/2017 Undisclosed Microsoft Deis workflow tool for Kubernetes 4/10/2017 Undisclosed Mirantis TCP Cloud cloud-like continuous updating 9/15/2016 $30 million Centurylink ElasticBox mutli-cloud applications management 6/14/2016 $20 million Apprenda Kismatic support and tooling for Kubernetes 5/19/2016 Undisclosed
 Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services. 
 Notion Capital has had a number of successful exits, including Shutl to Ebay, Star to Claranet, Trustev to TransUnion, and Wercker to Oracle.

 AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PastBook, a fast-growing technology company specialized in frictionless photo book creation, announces today it has completed a new investment round of $2M, bringing the total amount raised by the company to over $2.5M. 
 According to investor Dinko Valerio - Founder and former CEO of Crucell, “As a sparring partner and investor, I am very pleased with the roll-out and success of PastBook. 
 PastBook has been growing exponentially at a rate of 10x YoY in revenue for the last three years in a row, with the majority of customers (80%) being in the USA. 
 The company will use the proceeds of the new investment round to introduce new products and fuel marketing activities for its international expansion through the launch of its Intelligent Instant Photo Book platform in several European countries – including The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and the UK – in addition to the USA, Australia and Canada where PastBook already has a significant commercial presence. 
 Stefano Cutello, Founder and CEO of PastBook says, “With our Intelligent Instant Photo Book solution focused on Facebook and Instagram, we have proven that we’re un-tapping a new segment in the market: people who always wanted to have a photo book but never found the time to make one. 
The PastBook Intelligent Instant Photo Book platform provides the most frictionless way to create a photo book from any source.
 PastBook’s own developed algorithm combines a huge range of data with smart technology to automatically select the user’s best photos (with their captions and dates) from a chosen time period and instantly arranges them into a photo book within 60 seconds, without requiring user interaction. 
 PastBook’s sophisticated technology and algorithms, combined with its one-click photo book creation engine, sets its service apart from its competitors and the more traditional, mainstream, players in the photo book market: 95% of the books sold by PastBook are instant books, i.e. not edited by its customers (having had the option to make changes). 
 For 50% of the PastBook users, their PastBook photo book is the first photo book they have ever created. 
 PastBook also recently partnered up with RPI, a provider of premium quality photo book printing services with facilities in USA and Europe, along with partner facilities in Oceania. 
Through this partnership PastBook has been able to expand its global footprint and reduce shipping times.
PastBook is available on web and mobile and on the App Store.
 Founded in 2012 in Amsterdam, as part of RockStart Accelerator, PastBook has been named one of the ‘Hottest startup’s in Amsterdam” by Wired, nominated as “Rising Star” by Deloitte (Fast50) and listed as one of the “Top 5 Fastest Growing Tech Companies” by TheNextWeb (Tech5). 
It has also been featured by Facebook as Marketing Success Story (https://www.facebook.com/business/success/pastbook).
 PastBook is on a mission to help people preserve and relive memories, that are nowadays scattered between social networks and devices, by offering the most frictionless experience to create a beautiful photo book in seconds. 
 PastBook’s Intelligent Instant Photo Book platform automatically and intelligently selects the best photos from designated and instantly arranges them into a beautiful photo book, ready to be printed. 
 AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PastBook, a fast growing Deloitte Technology Fast 50 company, specialised in one-click photo products, unveils today its new logo and brand identity: a refreshed look that will accompany the scale-up in its growth plan for the future. 
PastBook’s primary logo comprises two elements: a symbol and a word-mark.
 The new logo is simple and modern while still incorporating a retro and nostalgic feeling, a characteristic that has always been a key component of the PastBook identity. 
 With the restyle comes a new primary color for the company, purple, or rather,   magic purple”, that perfectly captures the magical one-click technology that PastBook uses to create photo products for its users, and the shade of ‘nostalgia’ reminiscent of the 80s. 
 PastBook today also launches its new website, introducing its Global One-Click Photo Products platform. 
PastBook platform is unique on the market: this is all thanks to the company’s global printing facility network and sophisticated technology that automatically and intelligently selects the user’s best photos and instantly arranges them into high quality printed products - making the entire flow completely frictionless for the end user.
 There are a number of tools to build photo books from your phone today – including apps like Shutterfly, Mosaic, Printic and others, but today Dutch company PastBook is now joining the fray, bringing its online, collaborative photo book maker to the iPhone. 
 While the majority of photo book making utilities share a similar feature set – you select photos from your local gallery or social networks, customize the order or layout in some cases, then checkout to place your order, PastBook offers a couple of differentiated options with its service. 
Another thing you don’t often see available from smaller startups is the ability to print large books – but PastBook lets you print up to 500 pages (1000 photos) for $92.
 So PastBook still has a way to go to catch up with some of its stronger, more mature competition, but its pricing and free shipping may tempt you to give it a shot. 
The new PastBook iPhone app is here.
 In just over 12 months since we last covered PastBook, the photo book making service has lost a co-founder, and turned down an acquisition. 
 Described as a bridge round, adding to the $250,000 in seed funding it closed in September 2012, the new funding comes from two unnamed private angel investors and previous backers of PastBook, along with an unnamed private Netherlands-based fund. 
 Meanwhile, Giuseppe Prioriello, who was COO of PastBook, has left the startup “in an amicable way for personal reasons”, according to a company statement, leaving former eBay Italy technical leader Stefano Cutello as sole founder and CEO. 
 My understanding is that, after taking further investment and with Prioriello out of the picture, Cutello is now a majority shareholder in PastBook. 
 To that end, PastBook is announcing a raft of new features today. 
 Use-case examples given by PastBook include group-gifting whereby people share memories and pitch into buying somebody a gift, collating wedding, holiday or team-event memories, or creating an “In Memoriam” book for a loved one who has passed away. 
 In addition to new collaborative photo books, PastBook’s rolled out a white-label solution for publishers, wedding and funeral companies so that they’ll be able to provide the service under their own brand and domain. 
 AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At the 20th edition of the Deloitte Technology Fast50 award ceremony, PastBook (https://www.pastbook.com) - the global platform for one click photo products, based in Amsterdam and founded by Italian entrepreneur Stefano Cutello - won the category award as the #1 fastest growing technology company in the Media & Entertainment sector and made it to the top #3 of the entire competition ranking, with a turnover growth of 4623%. 
 I'd like to dedicate this award to Laura (RIP), a friend and key employee that joined PastBook when this growth was just about to start and helped us scaling all the way up till recent time: thank you.   
 - Stefano Cutello, Founder & CEO of PastBook 
 Amsterdam, The Netherlands-based PastBook has secured $250,000 in funding from Noro Venture Capital, Vidoze and a group of unnamed angel investors. 
PastBook received the first tranche of seed financing as part of the Amsterdam-based RockStart.Accelerator business acceleration program.
 There are a number of tools that help you rediscover your own memories through the digital trail left behind on social networks, photo sharing sites and whatnot (services like Timehop and Limetree spring to mind), which means PastBook emerges at a time when people are clearly starting to realize the value of culling through their personal, digitally-captured history to relive past moments. 
 PastBook says its eventual goal is to integrate all social networks, but has launched its beta version with Instagram for starters, enabling users to gather their photos in an online book by connecting the popular app to this dedicated web service. 
A users’s PastBook can even include comments and likes on Instagram photos in a bid to make their digital memories more “vivid”.
 A noteworthy side story: Cutello and Prioriello left two promising careers (one at eBay, one at a leading printing company) and their lives in Italy behind to go “all-in with PastBook”. 
 During their first 5 months in Amsterdam, PastBook co-founders lived in 20 square-meter containers while their properties in Italy were put on sale. 
PastBook lets its customers create photo albums from their social-media posts.

 Travis the Translator is a new project on Indiegogo that strips out most of the smartphone fluff to create a simple, portable translation device. 
 Language barriers may no longer be a problem thanks to Travis the Translator, a new device capable of translating 80 languages in real time. 
But Travis the Translator has also raised concerns.
 Travis the Translator, like Pilot or Google Pixel Buds, works on a very simple premise: two people who speak different languages put in an earpiece, which almost instantly translates the conversation. 
 The vice dean of Innovation and Technology in the Philology Department at Madrid’s Complutense University, Jorge Arús, says devices such as Travis the Translator are about making the speaker feel more secure: “They help get rid of the fear of speaking a foreign language in another country.” 
“It was originally introduced as Travis the Translator in a wildly successful global crowd-funding campaign in January 2017.”

The legendary Q&A website for programmers (and probably one of the most copy-and-pasted sites on the internet) Stack Overflow is being acquired.
 The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Prosus (the primary shareholder of Chinese gaming mega co/WeChat developer, Tencent) will acquire Stack Overflow for $1.8 billion. 
Stack Overflow co-founders Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky shared the following shortly after the news broke:
 Today's sale of Stack Overflow, most importantly, lets Stack Overflow continue as an independent site — and also mints 61 new millionaires. 
 Thanks and congratulations to @codinghorror, my cofounder, @pchandrasekar, the CEO, hundreds of current and ex-employees who helped build @StackOverflow, and literally millions of developers who have shared their knowledge freely and made programming a little bit better — Joel Spolsky (@spolsky) June 2, 2021 
 On iOS 14, Smart Stacks for widgets allow users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and then allow iOS to display the most relevant widget depending on the time of day, location, and more. 
 On iOS 15, Apple is taking Smart Stacks even further with Widget Suggestions, which automatically add and remove ‌widgets‌ in a Smart Stack depending on context. 
 For example, if a user has an existing Smart Stack which includes the Weather and Reminders widget, ‌iOS 15‌ may add a Calendar widget to the stack if the user has an upcoming meeting. 
 Then, after the meeting, ‌iOS 15‌ will remove the widget from the Smart Stack, reverting it to the stack that the user had set up with Weather and Reminders. 
 Apple says it hopes this new feature, which can be disabled on a per Smart Stack basis, will allow users to discover new and helpful ‌widgets‌. 
Dell has added second-generation AMD Epyc processors to its Azure Stack HCI systems and made them easier to deploy and manage.
Azure Stack is Microsoft’s Azure public cloud Hyper-V and HCI stack software running in Microsoft partners’ hardware.
Dell now factory-installs the Azure Stack HCI OS on the hardware and has added a call-home feature to the software.
The Azure Stack systems are managed by a Windows Admin Center extension to which Dell has integrated its Dell EMC OpenManage software.
If customers can withstand the siren calls of VMware vSAN and Dell’s VxRail HCI systems then Azure Stack HCI has just become more attractive.

Let's take a look at the top stacks on today's main slate.
 Each of the stacks I'm plugging today are facing a lefty, and the Houston Astros are my favorite of the bunch. 
 As is often the case when I suggest stacking the Astros, I'll acknowledge this lineup has impressive stacking depth. 
 The infield is stacked with options, too, including Jose Altuve ($4,300), Carlos Correa ($3,700), Alex Bregman ($3,600), and Yulieski Gurriel ($3,400). 
Feel free to mix and match as you build four-man Houston stacks.
This is another lineup with exceptional stacking depth.
 Even if you opt to use other stacks, I strongly suggest plucking Vaughn from this lineup as a standalone play. 
My favorite stacking options are burgeoning superstars Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
 The Guinness World Records title for the tallest stack of M&M's® has been taken to new heights by Will Cutbill (UK), who managed to balance five of the chocolate sweets on top of each other. 
He suddenly wondered how many he could stack on top of each other and started having a go.
 But I have a talent for chocolate - of any variety stacked, balanced or just simply eaten!   
 However, it seems Will isn’t going to stop at a record-breaking stack of M&M's®. 
 Prosus, one of the largest technology investors in the world, has announced that it is acquiring Stack Overflow for US$1.8 Billion. 
 Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar described this as   tremendously exciting news  . 
 In its press release, Prosus, which has headquarters in Amsterdam and is owned by the South African multinational Naspers, describes Stack Overflow as one of the 50 most popular websites in the world and states that it has: 
 It goes on to state that having been founded in 2008 as an open community-based question and answer website for the developer community, the company has expanded to include Stack Overflow for Teams: 
 As we reported when it came out of beta three years ago, Stack Overflow for Teams is a subscription service targeted at teams of developers within companies who want a secure, private space to ask and answer questions that they wouldn't want any outsiders to overhear. 
 Originally known as Stack Overflow Channels at its launch in 2017, the products business objectives included   to Make Money   - and this goal has already come to fruition big time as it must be generating a revenue sufficient to attract a $1.8 billion investment. 
 Prosus already owns stakes in Udemy and Codecademy and also in Skillsoft, a publisher of training software used by businesses and sees Stack Overflow as increasing its portfolio of   corporate learning companies  . 
 Prosus will reach 90% of the Fortune 100 across its corporate learning companies including Stack Overflow, Skillsoft, Udemy and Codecademy. 
“We are delighted to be welcoming Stack Overflow to the Prosus family as we increasingly focus on the future of workplace learning.
 Stack Overflow CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, responded with: 
 “We are excited to be joining the Prosus family, which catapults us into a new phase of growth and allows us to expand and accelerate Stack Overflow’s impact around the world. 
 Given Prosus’s focus on the future of the workplace, their partnership will allow our market leading SaaS collaboration product, Stack Overflow for Teams, to reach thousands more global enterprises, allowing them to accelerate product innovation and increase productivity by unlocking institutional knowledge.” 
 As far as the developer community is concerned it is unlikely that this acquisition will be particularly noticeable on day-to-day interactions on Stack Overflow Maybe instead of a new question being asked every 15 seconds on average, the rate may increase.

 Facing an evolving threat landscape, organizations have responded by building bigger security stacks, adding more tools and platforms, and making their defenses more complex—a new eBook from XDR provider Cynet (read it here). 
 Attackers find new, stealthier ways to penetrate an organization's defenses, and organizations build higher walls, buy more technologies to protect themselves, and expand their security stacks. 
 Moreover, it requires some understanding of what goes into a large company's security stack. 
What's in a Large Company Security Stack?
Modern security stacks have multiple moving parts and require specialized tools to manage the disparate platforms and service organizations install.
 Moreover, it also adds to the resource and financial costs of a security stack, and it still requires manual intervention constantly. 
 For lean organizations, building a large, multi-layered, and complex security stack can produce more work than it removes. 
 By including detection, endpoint protection, and network analysis, XDRs can respond more quickly than non-centralized stacks and can get the right response more often.

 With an aim to make moving abroad simple, Rotterdam-based HousingAnywhere, a rental accommodation marketplace, has raised €24M in its Series C round funding. 
 HousingAnywhere, a Rotterdam, The Netherlands-based rental accommodation marketplace for young professionals and international students, raised €24m in Series C funding. 
 Led by Djordy Seelmann, CEO, HousingAnywhere is a rental accommodation marketplace, with 10 million unique visitors per year and 60,000+ properties available for rent. 
Stanzazoo landlords and tenants will now gain access to a target group of nearly eight million users via the HousingAnywhere platform.
“Italy is fast becoming one of the most important markets for HousingAnywhere”
It is HousingAnywhere’s third acquisition over the past 12 months – the company has also acquired the Icelandic rental platform Rentmate and German classifieds website Studenten-WG.
HousingAnywhere said that the acquisition of Stanzazoo marked a further step towards reaching its goal of becoming the largest pan-European rental platform by the end of 2021.
 “Italy is fast becoming one of the most important markets for HousingAnywhere,” said Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 “Throughout 2021, HousingAnywhere will be scaling up its operations across Italy. 
 The Stanzazoo platform will remain accessible until February 7, after which all the traffic will be redirected to HousingAnywhere and accounts will be taken offline. 
 Until then, users on Stanzazoo will be invited to create an account on HousingAnywhere. 
 Current Stanzazoo users will have access to all the benefits that come from using the HousingAnywhere platform, such as AI for fraud detection, smart algorithms to determine the optimal rent (RentRadar), and easy digital payment solutions (HousingAnywhere Payments). 
 “Despite travel restrictions from the US and Asia still in place, we see European and local demand stepping in and taking over,” said Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 In a survey of 110 respondents conducted from June to August this year, HousingAnywhere found that a further 30% were keen to move abroad “as soon as possible”. 
 Rotterdam-based HousingAnywhere has bought Icelandic rental platform Rentmate, the latest step toward the Dutch company’s goal of becoming the largest end-to-end online rental platform in Europe by 2022. 
 “Iceland is an emerging destination for international students, so strengthening our presence there was a strategic choice,” explained Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 With the acquisition, landlords gain access to nearly 8 million potential tenants via HousingAnywhere’s self-service platform. 
 New Rentmate website visitors are already forwarded to the HousingAnywhere platform, but existing Rentmate accounts will remain accessible until the end of May. Rent payments made through the Icelandic platform will continue as is. 
 Founded in 2015, HousingAnywhere raised a €6 million Series B round back in 2018. 
 Photo features Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 HousingAnywhere, the world’s largest rental accommodation platform for young professionals and international students, has announced the acquisition of Hanover-based classifieds website Studenten-WG. 
 With this acquisition, HousingAnywhere solidifies its position in the German real estate market, especially in the lower price segments, and materializes its ambition of becoming the largest online rental platform in Europe by 2022. 
 HousingAnywhere has said the investment will fund product innovation, market expansion and ensure that the company remains the ‘world’s leading student accommodation platform for mid-term rentals’. 
 Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere said the company will use the new investment to scale up mainly in western Europe and develop the booking platform. 
HousingAnywhere founder Niels van Deuren told The PIE News the move comes following requests from students.
The company has also launched a pilot in May for the Erasmus University in Rotterdam where HousingAnywhere reserves a number of rooms on its platform for students.
 In 2017, HousingAnywhere raised €5m in Series A funding to fuel its expansion into Western Europe and the US. 
 Across 2020 and 2021, the company has acquired four companies, the same number as online car retailer Cazoo and Dutch online housing site HousingAnywhere. 
 HousingAnyWhere’s four acquisitions : Kamernet, Stanzazo, Studenten-WG, Rentmate 
 For 12-year-old HousingAnywhere, acquisitions also seem to be about geographical expansion. 
Rental accommodation marketplace HousingAnywhere has calculated that average price for single rooms in the UK capital were 3% lower in 2021 Q1 compared with Q1 in 2020.
 HousingAnywhere has also recently released its international rent index, which suggests that rental costs of private rooms in Milan, Madrid, Turin, Rome and Berlin had all declined by more than 10% in Q1 of 2021 compared to the same time in 2020. 
 On top of that, we expect supply shortages to return once the lockdowns are lifted,” HousingAnywhere CEO Djordy Seelmann said. 
HousingAnywhere is a rental accommodation platform with payments services.
The HousingAnywhere APITrack this API enables data interoperability between HousingAnywhere and its partners.
Developers can use the API to connect an inventory to the HousingAnywhere platform.
Bookings take place on the HousingAnywhere platform and the API will ensure that partner systems are updated in real-time.
 International students are still keen to move abroad despite travel concerns during COVID-19, according to a new survey by HousingAnywhere. 
HousingAnywhere deduced that young people looking to move abroad require this information to gain control over their movement and well-being in a foreign country.
 Based on the most recent HousingAnywhere International Rent Index Report for Q2 2020, quarterly rental prices have dropped in Q2 for nearly all European cities. 
   We currently see a tenants' market, where supply outnumbers demand,   says Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 “In this context, we have started our collaboration with HousingAnywhere, a recognised partner in the sector and fully aligned to our internationalisation strategy.” 
Students at the Università di Padova will access HousingAnywhere through a premium account.
 “To have the University of Padova join the list of over 150 partner universities is truly a pleasure as we feel that they are a great match with our platform,” HousingAnywhere CEO Djordy Seelmann told The PIE News, adding that the university has a high number of inbound and outbound students, something that is pushing an increasing number of Italian university towards looking for new solutions for student accommodation. 
HousingAnywhere partners with another 21 institutions in Italy.
 First quarter 2020 results from the online rental listings platform, HousingAnywhere, reveal a recent brake on what had been steadily climbing rents since January 2019. 
 “Italy, the first hard-hit European country by COVID-19 showed a relatively stable Q1 in terms of rental prices, as the majority of rental properties were already booked for Q1,” the accompanying commentary from HousingAnywhere notes. 
Listings across the HousingAnywhere platform are now shifting away from short-term — defined as one-night to one-month — with a corresponding 170 per cent jump in mid-term listings for one-month to one-year.
 Djordy Seelmann, chief executive officer of HousingAnywhere, reports more landlords are looking to local markets to find tenants and advertising mid- and longer term availabilities as a hedge against slumping international travel. 
 HousingAnywhere.com lists commercial housing properties and also facilitates short-term rental swaps, so exchange students can live overseas without giving up their existing tenancy agreements. 
 According to HousingAnywhere's latest, a rise in residential rents continued across Europe in Q4 of 2019, yet rents did decelerated in the more expensive cities such as London, Amsterdam and Munich.This hasn't been the case for cities that are cheaper by comparison. 
   The Q4 report reflects what we have been observing for a while now,   says Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 After continuous, and sometimes steep, increases in rent in major European cities over the past few years, prices seem to have plateaued and are leveling out this quarter, according to the HousingAnywhere International Rent Index for July 2019. 
 The HousingAnywhere International Rent Index analyses data from over 88,417 rental listings covering a timespan from Q1 2018 to Q2 2019 in major European cities, including: Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Madrid, Milan, Rotterdam, and Vienna. 
 “We already caught a glimpse of rental prices reaching a ceiling in the past quarter, but now the trend has been substantiated,” says Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 With an average rent of EUR 1287 per month, Rotterdam is the most expensive city in the HousingAnywhere International Rent Index. 
 In 2017, some 725,000 students went on exchange through the EU’s Erasmus+ program alone and more students “are choosing an experience abroad every year” said Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere. 
 “When studying abroad, the safety of the city is a key factor in the choice of study destination,” Simone Pouw, HousingAnywhere PR manager told The PIE News. 
 5. If you’re worried about losing your deposit and other scams: HousingAnywhere Like Airbnb, tenants just enter their study abroad destination into HousingAnywhere’s search bar, as well as their move-in and move-out dates, and it lists the available rooms and apartments. 
 On HousingAnywhere, tenants then get to filter the options according to accommodation type, furnished or otherwise, suitability for couples, bills charged, gender of tenant required, etc. 
 To guarantee a chosen place, users must pay the first month’s rent, which HousingAnywhere keeps safe and transfers to the advertiser 48 hours after you move in. 
HousingAnywhere.com is the global booking platform for mid-term rental accommodation.

 At the same time, Djordy Seelmann, CEO of HousingAnywhere told The PIE News the growing demand for furnished housing – which refers to apartments and rooms that come with amenities and services – has also caused supply for furnished housing to increase. 
HousingAnywhere’s Top 100 Cities for finding a Job – 2019 ranking attempts to make this search for an international city to work in a little easier with its analysis of hundreds of cities using city-level public data.
 HousingAnywhere, a European rental housing marketplace catering to international students, raised $29 million. 
 Rents in Berlin are generally lower than in other capital cities in Europe and the United States — with the price for an average-sized furnished apartment of about 750 square feet costing $1,180, according to a survey by HousingAnywhere European Rent Index. 
 Dutch incumbent operator KPN has closed its joint venture deal with pension provider APG, creating a new fiber player, Glaspoort, which will begin operations immediately. 
 While KPN will act as an anchor tenant on Glaspoort's network, the company says it will pursue an open-access wholesale policy   based on non-discriminatory terms.   
 Royal KPN NV said Wednesday that it is creating a new joint venture called Glaspoort together with APG, with operations starting immediately. 
 Combined with KPN's own roll-out efforts of approximately half a million households annually, this will result in circa 80% fiber coverage in 2026,   KPN said. 
 Private equity companies EQT and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners abandoned attempts to takeover Dutch operator KPN after it rebuffed an approach they made earlier this year, business newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad (FD) reported. 
 Citing sources at the two investment companies, the newspaper noted the parties had shelved the ambition after concluding the business couldn’t be taken over without the cooperation of KPN’s management or supervisory board, neither of which they achieved with their approach. 
Interest in acquiring KPN is nothing new with several parties linked to efforts to buy it over the years.
 The EQT and Stonepeak approach in April valued KPN at around $15 billion, Bloomberg reported. 
 In May, KPN rejected two separate unsolicited takeover approaches, including the joint bid by the two investment companies, on grounds neither added value to its growth strategy. 
 To better understand this story, and to consider whether other telecoms networks may have had similar security vulnerabilities to KPN’s, we need to look at how complex mobile networks are run. 
KPN essentially granted Huawei “administrator rights” to its mobile network by outsourcing work to the Chinese firm.
The Port of Moerdijk and KPN have signed an exclusive agreement to build a private corporate fibre and 5G network.
The new partnership between the port authority and KPN includes fibre to the office infrastructure in the existing port area and in the planned Logistics and Industrial Park.
 KPN and the Moerdijk Port Authority have a long history of partnership Ferdinand van den Oever, Director of the Port Authority, pictured, said, “The basis of our port is connectivity. 
Anja de Vos-Biemans (pictured) is Regional Director South at KPN.
 PUTRAJAYA: The Ministry of National Unity (KPN) will channel an allocation of RM20 million for repairs, maintenance and emergency works on non-Muslim houses of worship. 
She said KPN has prepared a guideline and procedures for applying for the allocation under the Financial Assistance for Non-Muslim Houses of Worship Programme to ensure transparency and accountability in channeling the funds.
 “The management of the houses of worship can obtain the application forms and get more details on the application process through KPN official portal and queries can be channeled directly to the ministry,” she said. 
 Swedish buyout firm EQT and US counterpart Stonepeak finally made a joint offer for KPN, only for the Dutch incumbent to reject it out of hand. 
 In a statement, KPN’s board said it reviewed the offers, but concluded that neither provided “tangible and material added value over KPN’s recently updated growth strategy.” 
 Doubtless EQT/Stonepeak and KKR would disagree with KPN’s assertion; nevertheless, it falls to them to come up with something more compelling that will win over one or more of the telco’s major shareholders. 
One obvious idea would be to offer a big enough chunk of change that would help KPN further accelerate its fibre rollout.
 Add that figure to the 2.5 million households that fall under KPN’s ongoing in-house fibre rollout, and it comes to 80 percent of households by 2026. 
KPN has embarked on this project in the face of stiff competition from Vodafone Ziggo.
It’s not unreasonable to think that KPN’s board might be more amenable to new investors that were prepared to finance an even more rapid fibre rollout.
 Indeed, as KPN’s latest quarterly results indicate, fibre is helping its fixed-broadband unit to turn a corner, albeit quite slowly. 
 Numbers published late last week show that KPN lost around 1,000 fixed broadband customers during the first three months of the year. 
 KPN attributed the slowdown in net customer losses to fibre: it activated 47,000 fibre connections during Q1, up from 21,000 in Q4. 
 Together with favourable underlying ARPA and ARPU trends, this gives us further confidence we will deliver on our ambition to grow mass-market service revenues by the end of this year,” said KPN CEO Joost Farwerck, in a statement late last week. 
 The Economic Affairs Ministry said in a report by Reuters it was aware of the rejected takeover bids for KPN, but refused to comment further. 
 Even if the government were prepared to sanction a foreign takeover of its incumbent operator, KPN shareholders themselves could still mount a defence. 
 As much as private equity firms would like to get their hands on KPN and its blossoming fibre footprint, the obstacles would appear at this point to be insurmountable. 
 KPN has been the subject of a number of takeover bids over the past few years, so Thursday’s report that there is yet another offer on the table, and a sizeable one at that, can come as little surprise. 
 Well, for starters, one of the PE firms in question is Sweden’s EQT, which, if various reports in the financial press are correct, is no stranger to KPN. 
The repeated linking of EQT is not so much a case of ‘no smoke without fire’ as it is a story of tenacity: it appears the firm is particularly keen to get its hands on KPN and as such is exploring all options.
 KPN recently set up a joint venture with pension fund APG to share the financial burden of rolling out fibre to over 900,000 premises in underserved areas of the Netherlands, having already pledged to deploy fibre to 2.5 million homes under its own steam. 
 Meanwhile, KPN’s financial figures remain uninspiring at best; a private equity-backed turnaround could be just the ticket. 
But it is questionable whether KPN is for sale.
 According to the newswires, he indicated on KPN’s Q3 results call last year that the telco would listen to any interesting proposals, but there is no real indication that attracting PE money is part of the company’s roadmap. 
Meanwhile KPN has previously shown that it has the ability to stop an unwanted takeover attempt.
 AMSTERDAM, April 19 (Reuters) - Dutch telecoms company KPN NV said on Monday that equipment supplier Huawei had not to its knowledge improperly monitored any of its mobile users, following a newspaper story that alleged a 2010 consultants’ report had flagged such a risk. 
 China’s Huawei, KPN’s main supplier for equipment in its 3G and 4G mobile networks, rejected outright any suggestion that it could have improperly monitored the telecom firm’s users. 
 The story published in De Volkskrant over the weekend cited a report prepared by consultancy Capgemini for KPN, which it said flagged that Huawei could have been monitoring users’ calls in 2010 without KPN knowing. 
 KPN confirmed the existence of the report, which has not been released by KPN or De Volkskrant, but said it had been intended to analyse risks. 
 “No supplier of KPN has ‘unauthorized, uncontrolled or unlimited’ access to our networks and systems, or is capable of eavesdropping on KPN clients,” the telecoms firm said, referring to the De Volkskrant story. 
KPN added that the Capgemini report had not established that Huawei had monitored any users or taken data.
 It added: “Partly on the basis of the risk analysis in question, KPN at the time decided not to outsource full maintenance of its core mobile network.” 
Huawei Netherlands said its workers did not have unauthorized access to KPN’s networks and data.
 In October 2020, KPN said Ericsson would build its core 5G mobile networks. 
The update comes just a month after investigative reporting from De Volkskrant suggested that Huawei readily had access to the KPN mobile network a decade ago.
 This gave Huawei the ability to eavesdrop on communications from phone numbers on the KPN network, including that of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, Chinese dissidents, and top government officials. 
 In the meantime, the three major network providers in the Netherlands, KPN, Vodafone and T-Mobile, have received a decision regarding which changes they needed to implement to their networks, said the Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
KPN previously announced that it would be replacing Huawei equipment at the core of its network with that of Swedish firm Ericsson.
Telecom companies KPN and T-Mobile have both attracted financial partners to ramp up their fibre rollout to households and businesses across the Netherlands.
 KPN and T-Mobile are both looking to up the ante in this space, and have secured financiers to support the sizeable infrastructure investments. 
 KPN is now backed by pension investment firm APG, while DTCP – the digital infrastructure investment arm of T-Mobile’s parent company Deutsche Telekom – is partnering with investment fund KKR to rollout its FttH programme. 
 KPN is already racing towards 3 million fibre optic connections in The Netherlands, with plans to clock 500,000 new households per year to add another 2.5 million by 2025. 
 By 2026, the telco hopes to occupy 80% of the country’s FttH landscape, and plans are well on track: KPN has added 100,000 new connections since the start of 2021 alone. 
 A €880 million joint venture split 50:50 with Netherlands-headquartered pension and asset management fund APG is now set to support the further rollout, with a partial focus on the ‘long tail’ of KPN customers – around 685,000 households and 225,000 businesses in villages and smaller business centres across The Netherlands. 
 “It is an attractive transaction, creating additional value for all stakeholders,” noted KPN CEO Joost Farwerck. 
 (Reuters) -KPN NV has rejected unsolicited takeover offers from a private equity consortium comprising EQT AB and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and another from U.S. investment firm KKR, the Dutch telecommunications company said on Sunday. 
 FILE PHOTO: KPN logo is seen at its headquarters in Rotterdam, Netherlands, January 30, 2019. 
 “Boards of KPN concluded that both approaches fail to provide tangible and material added value over KPN’s recently updated growth strategy,” the company said in a statement. 
 Addressing an earnings conference on Friday, KPN’s Chief Executive Officer Joost Farwerck said the company was investing in infrastructure for the first time in 26 years and is not seeking to be bought. 
 Both EQT and Stonepeak have been circling KPN since last year and started conducting due diligence last month, the FT reported, citing multiple people with direct knowledge of the talks. 
KPN also has a defence against unwanted takeovers in the form of a foundation that can build up a controlling stake to block any deal.
 This proved successful in 2013, when KPN won a lengthy battle against unsolicited interest from Mexico’s America Movil. 
KPN has released the Smart TV app for Android TV.
 This is great, as it allows KPN customers to watch TV channels without the need for a receiver. 
 With KPN Smart TV, you can watch live TV via Android TV. 
 Dutch operator group KPN’s healthy profit increase last quarter looks like a one-off, with revenue growth flat. 
Operating profit was up 11% but net profit was up 107% thanks to a one-off € 67m positive revaluation of KPN’s deferred tax asset and € 17m release of revenue related provisions in Wholesale.
 “During the year we saw encouraging base developments in our consumer segment with growth in our postpaid base and a stabilizing broadband base driven by fiber,” said KPN CEO Joost Farwerck. 
KPN’s numbers were in line with analyst expectations and its outlook is for more of the same.
 Nonetheless KPN shares were up 4% on the numbers, which is about as exciting as it gets for KPN shareholders. 
 Reports of a private equity firm wanting to buy a European incumbent can often be dismissed as far-fetched unless, as in the case of EQT’s alleged interest in KPN, those reports persist. 
Bloomberg has followed up a report in October that named EQT as a potential buyer of KPN with another one.
 The stock market welcomed the latest rumour, pushing KPN’s shares up 6.5 percent on Wednesday’s closing price to €2.64 on Thursday. 
That values KPN at €11.1 billion.
 The last time this rumour hit the headlines, KPN’s shares jumped to €2.45, valuing it at €10.3 billion. 
America Movil came close to a full takeover of KPN in 2013.
The Mexican telco group built a 30 percent position in KPN and made a move for the remaining 70 percent.
America Movil’s bid would have succeeded but for the dogged opposition of a KPN shareholder group.
This would allegedly involve buying certain fibre assets from KPN and merging them with its DeltaFiber unit.
Whether KPN would actually countenance any kind of deal – particularly one that would relieve it of highly-coveted fibre assets – is questionable.
 CEO Joost Farwerck reportedly said on his company’s most recent investor call that KPN is open to suggestions, but has no plans to be bought out. 
 KPN has unveiled a new plan to roll out fibre to the best part of 1 million premises in underserved areas at a cost of €1.2 billion, but will share the financial burden with pension fund APG. 
 The connections rolled out by the JV will be in addition to the 2.5 million connections KPN has pledged to achieve under its own steam in the coming years, meaning that in total the two projects will provide FTTH to 80% of Dutch households by 2026, as well as extending coverage for businesses. 
 The infrastructure rolled out by the JV will be a wholesale network, open to third-party retail providers, with KPN as the anchor tenant. 
 The big difference is that by joining the project from the start, APG helps KPN to fund the build, rather than to monetise it after the fact. 
Or as KPN puts it: “This transaction illustrates KPN’s ability to access long-term pension fund capital at attractive terms to help further accelerate and increase the rollout of a part of our state-of-the-art fibre network whilst crystallising significant value for KPN upfront.”
 KPN cedes some control by doing it this way, but the agreement with APG includes a call option on one share, which would enable the telco to take control of the unit and reconsolidate it in future. 
 KPN chief executive Joost Farwerck took the opportunity to talk up KPN’s progress in fibre and its market position in the Netherlands, making the usual remarks about the attractiveness of the APG deal for all involved. 
 Incidentally, KPN’s annual report for last year shows that the year-on-year improvement in fibre service revenues more than offset the decline in copper service revenues for the first time. 
 Netherlands-headquartered KPN reportedly filed a patent infringement case against Swedish vendor Ericsson, alleging violations of five patents involving wireless network functions. 
 There were apparently no further details in the filing, other than KPN stating it was seeking monetary compensation. 
 The spat comes close to six months after KPN signed a major five-year deal with Ericsson for its core 5G network, a move which came at Huawei’s expense. 
 At the time, Ericsson highlighted a century-long working relationship with KPN, an assertion which suggests the operator did not act lightly when initiating the US legal action. 
LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carlos Slim is putting the wreckage of his failed 2013 takeover of KPN to good use.
 If KPN stock treads water, Slim effectively borrows for less than nothing.

 He knew that automated shades manufacturer Hunter Douglas had a smart solution, but their shading program, at the time, was not easy for a custom integrator to take on, as it was historically focused on a retail model. 
 The timing was right: Just as Lumitech was starting up, Hunter Douglas changed the game for the automated shades by introducing its Custom Integrator Program. 
 Once they joined the program, it was clear that Hunter Douglas was fabric-focused: Lumitech went from carrying two sample books to eight. 
Hunter Douglas streamlines the process for selling automated shades for integrators.
 With new fabrics and design options to learn, Hunter Douglas offered extensive training to get Lumitech up to speed on the portfolio, measurement, installation, and integration of their smart platform PowerView Automation. 
 With new fabrics and styles, Hunter Douglas also provided new ways to demo the automated shades to clients, with materials such as sliders and samples that can be suction cupped to the window. 
 Hunter Douglas has unique tools that I hadn’t seen before, that we now use on a daily basis in the field,” Mitchell said. 
 By joining the Hunter Douglas CI Program, Lumitech could take advantage of the Hunter Douglas Installation Service (HDIS). 
 With the new options available after joining the CI Program, Lumitech had its first Hunter Douglas automated shading project. 
 With Hunter Douglas PowerView Automation, they were tied into the home’s existing Control4 system. 
 “Working with Hunter Douglas expanded the scenarios where we can offer automated shading with the fabric options, and it’s going to have an impact for Lumitech.”

 ROTTERDAM, Netherlands, and SAN FRANCISCO, July 9, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- MetrixLab, a global provider of online consumer research services, announced today that it has acquired MarketTools Research Solutions Inc., a leader in services and software for market research, from TPG Growth. 
MarketTools is known for pioneering some of the first research technologies on the Internet.
 MetrixLab will continue to operate MarketTools Research Solutions under the MarketTools brand name, led by its new CEO Simon Kooyman, who also serves as CEO of MetrixLab USA. 
   I am excited that two market-leading innovators in online market research, MetrixLab and MarketTools, have joined forces. 
 The MarketTools offering is now extended with MetrixLab solutions for digital and cross media research and customer experience management,   adds MarketTools and MetrixLab USA CEO Simon Kooyman. 
   MetrixLab shares the vision for helping clients uncover the consumer insights that lead to better business decisions, and shares a passion for data quality and innovation in online market research,   said Scott Arnold, outgoing president and CEO of MarketTools. 
MarketTools is the leading provider of services and software for market research.
 Through the use of advanced respondent engagement techniques, comprehensive analytic tools, and expert knowledge of marketing research, MarketTools helps clients innovate, optimize and execute programs that deliver high-value business impact. 
MarketTools research services are supported by a groundbreaking Advanced Analytics team and a suite of market research software.
MarketTools is headquartered in San Francisco.
 Greg Marek, VP Marketing at MarketTools 
 In the US, research technology specialist MarketTools has acquired Enterprise Feedback Management (EFM) firm CustomerSat, which will form the basis of a new Customer Insight Management division. 
CustomerSat Chairman and CEO John Chisholm has been named MarketTools EVP and General Manager of the business unit.
 Chisholm says the combination of the two firms will create a 'consumer insights powerhouse', and comments: 'With product lines spanning online surveys, analytics, panels, communities, and automated actions, the expanded MarketTools offering enables customers to leverage world-class, on-demand solutions that deliver truly actionable customer and market insights.' 
 MarketTools CEO Amal Johnson, to whom Chisholm will now report, says the two firms share a vision to deliver fully integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Customer Insight Management solutions that 'combine technology leadership with market research and EFM innovation'. 
 CustomerSat has offices in Mountain View, California and in the UK and is online at www.customersat.com , while San Francisco-headquartered MarketTools is on the web at www.markettools.com . 
 Rotterdam, Netherlands-based online research firm MetrixLab has agreed to acquire a stake in US firm Precision Sample, whose panels will be integrated with the former's MarketTools sample ecosystem. 
 Precision will eventually form MetrixLab / MarketTools' North American sample solution, but will continue to expand its sample only offering in the marketplace. 
We're confident that Precision Sample's innovative recruiting methodology will provide engaged respondents for MetrixLab and MarketTools clients and prove highly scalable as we work to expand its offerings into a global sample network.'
 MetrixLab, which acquired MarketTools just under a year ago from its short-term owner TPG Growth, has additional offices in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco, Shanghai, Hyderabad, London, Hamburg, Paris and Madrid, and conducts online research in more than 50 countries worldwide. 
 Web sites are at www.metrixlab.com , www.markettools.com and www.precisionsample.com . 
 He joined the company in 2014 as VP, Client Development, after senior roles at Ace Metrix, MarketTools, Wilcher Research Group, Harris Interactive, and GfK. 
 In July, SaaS industry-veteran Scott Arnold, former CEO of AppSense, MarketTools, and Borland Software, was named President and CEO to guide AuditBoard through its next phase of growth. 
 He previously held sales growth positions at UBMobile, MetrixLab, MarketTools and Nielsen. 
 Prior to Toluna, he held senior sales roles at MarketTools/MetrixLab, Nielsen and began his career at Nestlé US. 
 The online survey of 5,481 individuals was conducted by MarketTools Inc. 
 Nevertheless, a recent study by MarketTools found that 75 percent of consumers favor shopping at just one or two stores on a regular basis.

 Boen most recently worked at DIY research and ad measurement company Survata, after a career which included co-founding mobile-based consumer engagement and insights firm UBMobile (sold to Critical Mix in 2018); co-founding online data quality provider TrueSample (acquired by Imperium in 2017); and roles at Lucid, MarketTools and Zoomerang. 
 Earlier, he held senior roles at EmSense and MarketTools, having begun his career as a Senior Analyst at Thomson Reuters, before joining TNS NFO as an Account Executive. 
 But MarketTools has also published its own analysis of the factors affecting respondent engagement, in which it argues that the reality is less clear cut. 
 Up to a point, says MarketTools. 
 According to MarketTools: “While survey length proved to be generally predictive of most respondent engagement measures, there was wide variation in the design variables that were most influential in driving various measures of engagement.” 
 “The findings reveal that engagement is driven by a complex interaction among design variables,” says MarketTools. 
 Both white papers are available online, SSI’s here and MarketTools’ here. 
 Del Monte, working with new-media marketing firm MarketTools, will soon add an “I Love My Cat” social network to the mix. 
 He has also held leadership roles at comScore MediaMetrix, IRI and MarketTools. 
 Prior to this, he was President and CEO of comScore Media Metrix, President and COO of MarketTools, and COO of Information Resources Inc (IRI). 
 Microsoft recently commissioned MarketTools, an independent research firm, to survey a group of both students and professionals to get a sense of how they use their email.

Jedlix is one of those hidden champions.
 Still, the Jedlix service is strictly opt-in for consumers and also a question of working with OEMs such as Renault recently.

Jaguar now cooperates with the Dutch smart-charging specialist Jedlix to integrate the latter’s application into the infotainment system of the Jaguar I-Pace from early 2020.
Jedlix helps to optimise charging processes.
 Jedlix also points out, its partners such as Eneco, Engie, or Tennet reward Jedlix for smart charging and that these revenues received are shared with the users of the app. 
 Jedlix however, is also working with BMW or Tesla. 
Dutch smart charging specialist Jedlix and the Elaad Competence Centre have concluded that Renault Zoe can be used in a balancing capacity of TenneT in the Netherlands.
 According to Jedlix, this kind of suitability is further proof that electric vehicle batteries can be efficient and competitive resources that contribute to increasing the flexibility requirements of national grids. 
 Two years ago, Jedlix and Elaad made the same tests with Tesla cars. 
 “In a previous study with Jedlix, we also found a positive effect on the distribution network when we respond to transmission network signals, which is crucial for the long-term introduction of electric vehicles,” says Elaad Director Onoph Caron. 
 Since 2018, Jedlix and Dutch network operator Tennet has been offering the flexibility of charging networked vehicles as secondary control power. 
Tesla drivers can already benefit from the Jedlix app in Belgium and the Netherlands.
 Dutch start-up Jedlix is offering a “smart”, flexible charging service for Tesla electric vehicle (EV) drivers. 
 With thousands of customers using the app already in the Netherlands and Belgium, Jedlix has launched in France with the help of renewable energy suppliers ekWateur and Plüm Énergie and solar developer GreenYellow Energie. 
The partner companies offer Jedlix users a reward for each kilowatt-hour of electric vehicle (EV) charge driven through the app with ekWateur stating the rewards reduce the cost of charging by at least 20%.
 Plüm Énergie co-founder and president Vincent Maillart said: “Thanks to the partnership between Jedlix and Plüm Énergie, owners of electric vehicles can now optimize their consumption, save money, benefit from the greenest electricity on the market and support the development of new renewable production sites.” 
 By encouraging users to charge at periods of lower electricity demand, the Jedlix app also offers grid balancing benefits. 
 Although only Tesla owners can benefit at present, Jedlix said it wants to expand to other marques and is working with BMW and Renault – which acquired a quarter of Jedlix in 2017 – in the Netherlands, and Jaguar in Belgium. 
 The research report includes an in-depth analysis of the competitive framework of the Electric Vehicle Grid Integration Solutions market, which is defined by companies such as Enel X , CrowdCharge , Nuvve , NewMotion , Hitachi , The Mobility House , Kaluza , Geotab , Fermata Energy and Jedlix. 
 Renault has entered into a number of eMobility collaborations: Besides a three-point agreement with EDF on electric mobility and energy services, these include a cooperation with Total and Jedlix and Enel X. Furthermore, Renault now officially launched its EV sharing service Moov’in in Paris. 
A new agreement with Total and Jedlix sees the launch of a mobile app – the Z.E.
Renault announced that it is acquiring a 25% stake in a Dutch start-up and EV charging specialists Jedlix.
 With Jedlix, we will provide new services to make charging – and thus the use of electric vehicles – even more easy and affordable.” 
 Jedlix already offers a similar service for Tesla users, including an option for home charging, but the acquisition by Renault will see the start-up deliver a tailored app for Renault ZOE users. 
 Jedlix, originally launched by the Eneco Group, has partnered with Renault, BMW and Tesla and has tailored the app for both home charging and public infrastructure use. 
 “Our partnership with Groupe Renault will help us to create the best possible smart charging service and to offer its benefits to a large and diverse customer base throughout Europe,” Jedlix’s managing director Ruben Benders said. 
 Groupe Renault, Total and Jedlix join forces in smart charging 
 Secondly, the group has signed an agreement with Total and Jedlix, its long-standing smart charging partner, for a ZE Smart Charge offer to be launched in the first half of 2019 in France. 
 The charging flexibility provided by Renault ZOEs through Jedlix platform, will be monetized through the TotalFlex services. 
 Eneco subsidiary Jedlix will develop a version of its existing smart charging app, to adapt it to Renault ZOE. 
 Recently, Eneco founded the company Jedlix with the aim to expand its smart charging services on an international scale. 
In the near future the service of Jedlix will also be available for other sustainable energy companies.
Eg. there’s an App (by Jedlix) that allows its users to earn money by using technology to charge the car in the middle of the night when the wind is still producing power but there is little demand for it.
Eg. there’s an App (by Jedlix) that allows its users to earn money by using technology to charge the car in the middle of the night when the wind is still producing power but there is little demand for it.
BMW has partnered with Dutch energy providers Eneco and Jedlix for such services when it is launched in The Netherlands.
Kraftwerke & Jedlix teamed up on a smart EV charging pilot focused on demand-response solutions forming a virtual power plant.
 We’ve already started a project in the Netherlands in order to understand the possibilities of electric cars with our partner Jedlix, where we offer balancing power. 
 The French lubricants company also committed in 2018 to work with Renault Group and Jedlix, the carmaker’s long-standing smart charging partner, to develop a ZE smart charge offer. 
Eg. there's an App (by Jedlix) that allows it's users to earn money by using technology to charge the car in the middle of the night when the wind is still producing power but there is little demand for it.

 Groupe Renault’s second partnership is with Total and Jedlix, the Group's long-standing smart charging partner. 
 Groupe Renault has also signed an agreement with Total and Jedlix, the Group’s long-standing smart charging partner, for a ZE Smart Charge offer to be launched in the first half of 2019 in France.

 An experimental oral formulation of edavorone for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), called TW001, demonstrated promising pharmacological and safety data in a Phase 1 clinical trial, according to the biotech Treeway. 
 Results showed that TW001, Treeway’s lead compound, had higher bioavailability than Radicava. 
 “It is Treeway’s mission to identify novel treatment routes for ALS patients and we believe that this study indicates that an oral formulation of edavarone may offer patients a better quality of life through a simpler and more effective route of administration,” Ronald van der Geest, chief development officer of the Netherlands-based Treeway, said in a press release. 
 Merit Cudkowicz, MD, director of the ALS Multidisciplinary Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and a key adviser to Treeway, said the Phase 1 trial results “are a promising sign for ALS patients, who are in high need of better and more patient-friendly treatments for their disease. 
Treeway is developing TW001 as a disease-modifying therapy for convenient daily treatment of patients with ALS.
Dutch biotech company Treeway has won orphan drug status for its investigational treatment for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).
 Ronald van der Geest, chief development office at Treeway, said: “Obtaining orphan designation for TW001 from the FDA is an important milestone for Treeway.

 Meeting attendees buzzed about an announcement on December 10, 2015, from Muller’s pharmaceutical company, Treeway, of positive Phase 1 results. 
 Now, Treeway plans a Phase 2/3 study. 
 His company, Treeway, is pursuing an oral version of the drug, which would be more convenient for chronic treatment of ALS. 
 In two Phase 1 studies, Treeway administered multiple doses of the oral formulation to healthy volunteers, and single doses to people with ALS, Treeway CEO Inez de Greef told Alzforum. 
 While Treeway provided no data to directly compare with the intravenous formulation, de Greef said that adequate amounts of the oral drug entered the blood.

 The Gorilla Treeway joins the Big Cat Crossing as the zoo’s latest attempts to stave off general public recognition that zoos, well, suck. 
 The zoo’s so-called “Great Ape Trail,” to which the Treeway is being added, is 200 feet in length.

DUNKIRK — The owner of the property tied to the Refresco plant is trying to force the city of Dunkirk to replace water infrastructure to the Dunkirk business.
 Atwater Capital LLC, headquartered in Delray Beach, Fla., has filed an Article 78 lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Mayville to compel Dunkirk to take immediate action to replace the water pump, water storage tank, pump house and connecting water lines to Refresco after the items were damaged Dec. 4 in a fire in the pump station that supplies Refresco’s fire protection station with water. 
Some of the property is leased to Refresco and some is vacant.
 “On or about December 9, 2020, the town of Dunkirk contacted Refresco, the tenant at Atwater’s property, and mandated that Refresco conduct a documented facility tour/audit every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day, to ensure that there are no fire or fire hazards present,” attorney Joseph Calimeri of Jamestown firm Wright, Wright and Hampton wrote in the lawsuit. 
“The town of Dunkirk’s unilateral requirement has caused Refresco to have employees or independent contractors on site at all times to conduct the mandated audits.
Such a requirement has caused significant expense and severe hardship to both Refresco and Atwater.”
 An email from Ryan Mourer, Dunkirk town code enforcement officer, to Refresco on Dec. 9 stated the repair was supposed to be at least eight weeks, with the town official saying the town was reaching out to the state for recommendations how to handle the situation.

Rating Action: Moody's assigns B1 rating to Refresco's €400 million Term Loan
 Milan, July 22, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service, (  Moody's  ) has today assigned a B1 rating to the new E400 million senior secured term loan maturing in March 2025 issued by Refresco Holding B.V., a fully owned subsidiary of Sunshine Mid B.V. 
 Refresco will fund the potential deal through a mix of debt of E400 million, existing cash and potential drawing under the revolving credit facility of E300 million and E150 equity contribution from the selling shareholders, such that the deal is leverage positive. 
 While the company is currently weakly positioned in the rating category due to its high leverage, the rating reflects Refresco's (1) significant scale and relevance as the largest independent beverage solutions provider in Europe and North America; (2) expected profit growth over 2020-21 and modest positive free cash flow generation; (3) wide product offering in terms of drinks and types of packaging; and (4) good track record in integrating acquired assets. 
 Despite the weakened economic environment due to the coronavirus outbreak, Refresco's operating performance has been less impacted compared to other global beverage companies. 
 This is because Refresco has a low exposure to the   out of home   channel, which experienced the most severe trading conditions during the full lock-down period. 
 For Refresco, this channel represents around 10%-15% of total revenue, compared to around 30%-40% on average for other European beverage companies. 
 In addition, Moody's expects that Refresco's total earnings in the first half of the year will grow modestly supported by the contribution from AZPACK, a company specialized in manufacturing complex products for branded beverage companies in the US, which was completed in the first quarter. 
 Moody's expects that Refresco's adjusted debt to EBITDA would decline towards 7.0x in 2020, excluding the impact of the potential acquisition. 
 Including the new E400 million acquisition financing debt and the EBITDA contribution from the potential new acquisition (and assuming cash and equity included in the funding mix), pro-forma Moody's adjusted debt to EBITDA would improve by around 0.5x in 2020 versus the 7.0x for Refresco stand alone, further declining towards 6.0x in 2021. 
 Refresco's liquidity is currently adequate, supported by its (1) cash balance of E307 million as of March 2020; (2) E200 million revolving credit facility (which will be upsized to E300 million); (3) modest positive FCF generation; and (4) long-term debt maturity profile. 
 Refresco, headquartered in Rotterdam, is a leading independent manufacturer of soft drinks and juices for A-brands and retailers. 
Refresco is controlled by funds managed and advised by PAI Partners and BCI.
 Refresco, a global leader among independent bottlers for retailers and A-brands in Europe and North America, has announced plans to expand operations in Greenville County by late April. 
 Located at 1990 Hood Road in Greer, Refresco’s expansion will enable the company to meet growing demand for manufacturing and packing capabilities. 
 “The entire team at Refresco in Greer has worked hard to earn this opportunity to grow the business,” said Refresco Greer Plant Manager William Wise. 
Greer Mayor Rick Danner commended Refresco for being excellent corporate citizens and for bringing 25 new jobs to the community.
 “Refresco is known for its global procurement expertise that creates quality, availability and cost advantages for customers the world over, and the company is proud to call the city of Greer home to one of its operational facilities,” Danner said.

 Rotterdam, the Netherlands, November 14, 2019 – Refresco announces that it has entered into an agreement with AZPACK (Arizona Production & Packaging) to acquire their manufacturing activities located in Tempe, Arizona, USA.

 Now his Bithell Games studio is working on its first licensed game — John Wick Hex, what publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment and Lionsgate term as an “action-oriented strategy game.” 
 So when Good Shepherd Entertainment and Lionsgate Games contacted Mike Bithell about a potential John Wick project, the idea was to go for a slightly offbeat approach to avoid falling to the same hurdles. 
Good Shepherd Entertainment and developer Shiny Shoe have released their Friends and Foes update for Monster Train.
 After initially being revealed earlier this year, Bithell Games and Good Shepherd Entertainment have today announced the release date for the strategy action game John Wick Hex, and it’s coming a lot sooner than you may think.

 The design has been granted LR descriptive notes ‘Digital SAFE (AL2)’, ‘Digital MAINTAIN (AL2)’, ‘Digital PERFORM (AL3)’ and ‘Cyber SECURITY’, confirming its compliance with LR’s digital ShipRight procedures. 
 LR reviewed Jiangnan’s digital VLGC ship design and awarded AiP in accordance with LR’s digital ShipRight procedures for the ‘assignment of digital descriptive notes for autonomous and remote access ships’, which defines an Accessibility Level (AL) to a digital system, and the ‘assessment of cyber security for ships and ships systems.’ 
 {mprestriction ids=  1,2  }LR and RaonX have developed the ShipRight FastTrack (FT) FEA software to generate a qualified FE mesh model from 2D / 3D plans without the need for excessive human intervention. 
 “We have tested ShipRight FT, which has been mutually developed by RaonX and Lloyd’s Register, with the major commercial ship type designs and decide to adopt ShipRight FT for the hull initial design of our newbuilding projects to improve our design process by minimising our FE analysis and evaluation time,” said Hong-Ryeul Ryu, general manager at HHI basic hull design department. 
 There are grades of AL-SAFE, recently updated in ShipRight, our design assessment tool, with more of a focus on levels of remote access granted to a system.” 
 We use our Digital Ships ShipRight (previously named ‘Cyber-enabled ShipRight’) procedure to provide assurance that the system has been integrated into the ship, with regards to reliability and safety. 
 Lloyd’s Register (LR) has released a new underwater noise notation and ShipRight procedure on underwater radiated noise with the intention of helping shipowners minimize underwater noise emissions when operating in sensitive environments, the company said. 
 S.L., Skelex, ATOUN Inc. and others. 
 Honda's innovation incubator, called the Honda Xcelerator, is collaborating with Germany's Skelex to to implement the technology in the manufacturing environment, which it showed off on Monday ahead of its appearance at CES. 
 Update, 12:20 p.m.: Updated to clarify Honda did not create the Skelex technology. 
 Rather, Honda Xcelerator is working with Skelex to implement the technology. 
Gaurav Genani founded SkelEx to develop exoskeletons for large scale manufacturing companies in 2013.
Sales of the SkelEx 360 have seen revenue grow x4 since 2017.
It’s preparing to launch the SkelEx 360 Neck Support.
 The unique sell: “SkelEx supports the arms, back and body and weighs 2kg. 
The view from Rotterdam: “In the Netherlands there is an openness to try new things (SkelEx was one of the first commercially available industrial exoskeletons in the world).
 Rotterdam is in an excellent location with regards to European manufacturing (across automotive, aerospace and shipbuilding), which is key for SkelEx. 
 Two in particular caught my eye: the Chairless Chair from German company Noonee, and the 360 from Dutch manufacturer Skelex. 
 The Skelex shores things up, and provides additional bionic strength around the shoulders and arms. 
 One product being tested is supplied by SkelEx in Rotterdam, whose FlexFrame technology adapts itself to the user’s body shape and size to support the ergonomic movement of joints and transfer weight to the lower body, storing and releasing energy to compensate for gravity while ensuring comfort and long-term well-being for the user. 
 “Our first exoskeletons were born out of the need of aerospace manufacturer Airbus for a padded mechanical exoskeleton for aircraft maintenance,” says Ivar de Wit, European sales manager for Skelex, whose clients include French boating giant Beneteau. 
 The SkelEx 360-XFR is a tool for light, repetitive tasks up to 5kg, but Heesen is also considering exoskeletons for its female workers in certain departments who are more at risk from lifting heavy objects than their stronger male colleagues. 
 The other partners in the cluster are: Get in the Ring, Johan BV, Skelex, VenturesOne, UNL Global, High Tech XL, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Singapore and the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO). 
 Laevo, SkelEx & Noonee exoskeletons by ITURRI 
 Not ITURRI, distributor of the Laevo, SkelEx, Noonee and Bioservo exoskeletons. 
 Two of these aids – the Paexo from Ottobock and the Skelex 360 from Skelex – are currently being tested by Audi in its paint shop, assembly and toolmaking shop at the Ingolstadt site. 
Both the Paexo and the Skelex 360 are worn like a backpack on the shoulders and secured in place with a belt around the hips.
 Audi is currently testing the Paexo from Ottobock and the Skelex 360 from Skelex, with both exoskeletons worn like a backpack on the shoulders and secured in place with a belt around the hips. 
 Designed by Ottobock and Skelex, these two external support structures help workers while performing overhead tasks by protecting their joints and tiring their muscles less quickly. 
 The largest consumer electronics trade show will feature at least two dedicate exoskeleton companies this year, SkelEx and Laevo. 
 Honda wants to make work more comfortable for its production associates, and is introducing a collaboration with startup Skelex. 
 Through the Honda Xcelerator program, the company is looking at implementing Skelex's ergonomic device at its manufacturing plants. 
 Honda believes the human touch is still required to achieve high quality and flexibility in manufacturing, and the Skelex's ergonomic device allows users to reach and lift while minimizing repetitive strain injuries. 
 Skelex 360 enhances the natural motion of the arms and torso, creating a sensation of weightlessness in the arms when reaching overhead. 
 Presenters included users from the automotive and aerospace industries: Ford Motor Company, DAIMLER AG, AUDI AG, Airbus Operations; developers from Laevo, NooNEE, COMAU and Skelex; experts in Occupational health and Ergonomics and third-party technology analysts. 
 In collaboration with startups Monolith AI, noonee, Skelex, and UVeye, Honda Xcelerator’s Industrial Innovation Pavilion will offer demos ranging from ergonomic devices designed to reduce risk of repetitive strain injuries on an assembly line to an AI-powered inspection technology that will dramatically change how the auto industry approaches quality-control. 
 Robotics and Drones: Drones for Work, Laevo, SkelEx 
 That includes Monolith AI and its predictive model design performance software, Noonee and its chairless char exoskeleton, Skelex and its ergo-skeleton for reducing strain on the body during harder or repetitive tasks as well as UVeye and its AI-driven, 360-degree vehicle inspection system. 
 Medications such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril, Cycloflex, and Flexiban), carisoprodol (Soma), and methocarbamol (Skelex) are often prescribed to treat painful muscle spasms; they are usually used for short-term relief.

 UNHCR and partner Arab Institute for Human Rights (AIHR) further developed the first Arabic-language portal in Tunisia, which aims to collect scientific and editorial resources related to asylum issues in the country and region. 
 Violence against women in Afghanistan is still on the rise, AIHR says relevant organizations should help prevent the impunity for the perpetrators. 
 “Fifty-two percent of the cases could have been dealt with through counseling and the other cases referred to the Ministry of Interior and Attorney General’s office,” said Shabnam Salehi, a member of AIHRC to media. 
 As UNHCR started its new programming year, partnership agreements were renewed with the Tunisian Refugee Council (CTR), the Arab Institute for Human Rights (AIHR) and the Tunisian Association for Management and Social Stability (TAMSS), covering the full spectrum of protection, assistance, advocacy and capacity-building activities. 
 Together with partner AIHR, UNHCR launched an online platform on asylum in Tunisia. 
The Academy to Innovate HR (AIHR) has pointed out three prime actions in this regard –
Erik van Vulpen is the founder of Analytics in HR (AIHR).
 Arab Institute for Human Rights (AIHR) - capacity building and advocacy on international protection and asylum issues, including in the context of mixed populations movements and legal assistance. 
 As part of UNHCR’s continued engagement with the local authorities in Tunisia, on 24 March, UNHCR and its partner the Arab Institute for Human Rights (AIHR) organized a focus group discussion with the municipalities of Tunis, Raouad, Ariana, Marsa and Sousse. 
 Namely, UNHCR partner AIHR organized a two-day training (8–9 May) for journalists with the title “Asylum and mixed migration issues in times of crisis; editorial requirements and principles of ethical journalism”. 
 Moreover, AIHR and UNHCR organized a series of academic debates (26–28 May) with participation from university professors and PhD students on the subject of international protection of refugees and stateless persons. 
 During December, UNHCR and its partner the Arab Institute for Human Rights (AIHR) finalized a reference document drafted along with the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training aimed at improving socio-economic inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers in Tunisia, due to be published in January.

 Rotterdam, the Netherlands-based Parx Plastics is broadening the scope of the antimicrobial technology it developed, patented and now markets for plastic materials. 
 The company has set its sights on the burgeoning silicone market with a separate entity, first established in 2017, called Siliarity NV to manage and market its bio-based technologies for silicone materials starting with antimicrobial technologies based on or derived from the Parx Plastics patents and knowhow. 
 As the antimicrobial technology for liquid silicone rubber (LSR) progresses towards industrial scale, Parx Plastics has now acquired a majority of the shares in Siliarity through a restructuring of the share capital. 
 Parx Plastics’ technology is based on a biomimetic approach: the technology uses a biocompatible trace element that in skin acts as the defense mechanism against microbes, a mechanism that is mimicked in plastic and polymers. 
 Testing of the new antimicrobial-enhanced LSR is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2019, after which the launch of the material will come in sight, Parx Plastics noted. 
Parx Plastics’ EU patent application for the use of its technologies in polymer parts of orthopaedic implants (e.g. hip and knee joints) has been granted.
 “The Parx Plastics technology improving the resistance to adhesion of bacterial biofilms to the surface of orthopaedic prostheses parts made from UHWMPE with Vitamin E, represents a further step forward in better controlling the risks of infection.” 
 For the verification of the characteristics of the technology developed by Parx Plastics and its functionality in UHMWPE with Vitamin E, the company cooperated with different universities and an accredited laboratory. 
 The microbial load detected on the surface of samples integrated with the Parx Plastics technologies, after different times of contact, is quantitatively less than the value obtained on normal samples without this technology, obtaining percentage of inhibition of 99.99% after 48 hours. 
Other in-vivo studies have shown that the Parx Plastics technologies prevent biofilm adhesion on the surface.

 Signicat, the digital identity company, has acquired digital identity specialist Connectis, to compete as one of the strongest digital identity platforms in Europe. 
 Connectis primarily delivers digital identity solutions to customers in the Netherlands, particularly organisations in the public sector, health care, insurance and financial services. 
 Connectis allows customers to log in to online services using DigiD, eHerkenning, Facebook, Google, eIDAS, iDIN and many other digital identity methods. 
70% of all transactions using the eHerkenning identity and authorisation system (one of the most prevalent identity schemes in the Netherlands) are performed using Connectis infrastructure.
 Connectis develops secure solutions for online identification, authentication and authorisation for more than 350 organisations. 
 • Connectis Identity Broker: With connections to multiple electronic identities, such as eHerkenning, iDIN, DigiD, and more. 
 • Connectis Identity & Access Management (CIAM): A comprehensive, yet fast and user-friendly CIAM solution. 
 Signicat is interested in developing further into the sectors Connectis’ has a footprint in, particularly in the government and healthcare sector. 
 “With Connectis joining Signicat, we are not only expanding our reach and customer base, we are creating Europe’s strongest digital identity platform. 
 “It’s time for Connectis to take the next step, towards a prominent role on the European market.” 
 said Jeroen de Bruijn, CEO, Connectis. 
 Some of the key players in Geochemical Services Market include Auth0 , CA Technologies, Capgemini, Connectis , Gemalto, Google, HCL, IBM , IDaptive, Jumio, JumpCloud, Microsoft, Okta, One Identity, OneLogin , Oracle, Ping Identity , SailPoint Technologies, Salesforce and Simeio Solutions. 
 In the group, he calls himself Connectis, but outside his newfound digital identity, he is understood to be the managing director of a real estate firm near the capital Berlin. 
 To Connectis, US President-elect Joe Biden is a criminal who could never be president. 
 At one point, Connectis shared an article claiming survivors of the Holocaust would receive additional aid during the pandemic:   More than 70 years of robbery of Germans!   his caption read,   This has to stop!   
 DW spoke on the phone to the man understood to be behind the alias Connectis, and emailed him for comment on his role within the Telegram group. 
 In the phone call, he did not confirm or deny he was the user Connectis — and said he would answer only written questions. 
 Connectis, who appears to be the group's chief administrator, is fueling this belief with cryptic messages. 
   In my view, there is no other option,   Connectis says with conviction. 
 Content posted by Connectis suggests that he, too, was at the protest where the attempted storming occurred, according to an analysis conducted by DW. 
IFS has announced Connectis as a new partner in Spain that few outside of the Iberian peninsular and Latin America will have heard of.
 Connectis are part of the Getronics group, and is the brand used across the above region. 
 Connectis as a brand consists of acquisitions made by Aurelius of different ICT services companies including, according to their website: Thales Information Systems, Steria Iberica, NEC Enterprise Solutions EMEA business and Telvent Global Services. 
While it is odd that the historic names are still listed on those sites it will be interesting to see which solutions Connectis implements for its customers going forward or whether it maintains relationships with all of them.
 For Connectis this may be another solution to offer customers or the only solution they will offer, Íñigo Rodriguez Lizundia, Industry Sector Director in Connectis commented: “IFS Applications perfectly suit our philosophy of providing our customers with innovative business solutions using the latest technologies, and we knew from the outset that both its ERP offering and its business culture were aligned with ours. 
What will be interesting is whether this deal is extended into other countries that both Connectis and Getronics operate in.
 Gustavo Brito, CEO of IFS Ibérica for the moment seems happy to have won over such a large partner commenting: “We are very pleased to be working with Connectis, whose presence throughout Spain will help us deliver extended local support to our customers. 
 In addition, much of our potential market lies in industrial manufacturing, for which IFS has a very powerful offering and where Connectis boasts great expertise.” 
It will be interesting to see how Connectis update the information for Oracle and Infor and whether the partner name will change to the current brand.
It will also be interesting to see what other customer wins are achieved by Connectis for any of the three ERP brands during the rest of the year.

 Recent studies have confirmed that DRibbles (defective ribosomal products-containing blebs) isolated from tumor cells with the induction of autophagy and inhibition of lysosomal/proteasomal activity are sufficient to stimulate dramatic T-cell activation and kill carcinoma cells in different tumor models such as melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer and liver cancer.13–19 Moreover, we have demonstrated that ubiquitinated proteins (UPs) are the critical TAA source of DRibbles which induce the antitumor efficacy. 
 In our previous studies, we enriched UPs from tumor cells after proteasome inhibition by Ni-NTA agarose beads conjugated with ubiquitin-binding protein Vx3. 
 The primary antibody was anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:1000, Sigma, #3933) and the secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:5000, eBioscience). 
 The levels of ubiquitin (Figure 3B) in the whole cell lysate (lane 2), unbound lysate (lane 3) and α-Al 2 O 3 -UPs (lane 4) were measured by Western blot. 
The results showed that the level of ubiquitin protein in α-Al 2 O 3 -UPs (lane 4) was markedly higher than that in the whole cell lysate (lane 2) and in the unbound lysate (lane 3) when the same amount of total protein was loaded.
(A) α-Al 2 O 3 -CONH-Vx3 was used to enrich ubiquitinated proteins from 4T1 tumor cell lysate treated with bortezomib and ammonium chloride.
 Anti-ubiquitin antibody was used to detect the ubiquitin in the whole cell lysate (lane 2), unbound lysate (lane 3) and α-Al 2 O 3 -UPs (lane 4) by Western blot analysis. 
 Dribbles, which are isolated from tumor cells with autophagy induction and lysosomal/proteasomal activity inhibition, carry abundant ubiquitinated short-lived proteins which are almost not contained in inactivated whole-cell tumor vaccines owing to rapid degradation.15,17,19 Our previous studies found that DRibble vaccine could efficiently cross-prime antigen-specific T cells and induce strong anti-tumor effects in several tumor models.16–20,40 We further determined that UPs in DRibbles play the role as main TAAs in inducing anti-tumor efficacy, and furthermore, much more UPs could be acquired from tumor cells lysate than carried in DRibbles.16,17,19,20 
 In the previous study, we enriched UPs from tumor cell lysate using Ni-NTA agarose beads coupled with ubiquitin-binding protein Vx3.

 LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elliott Advisors (UK) Limited (“Elliott”), which advises funds that as at the date of this release collectively hold an interest in more than 3% of the share capital of NN Group N.V. 
 (“NN Group” or the “Company”), today published a presentation making the case for its strong belief in NN Group’s uniquely compelling investment proposition and its significant value-creation potential. 
Elliott has significant experience as an investor in the insurance industry and has devoted considerable time and resources into understanding NN Group’s unique industry and financial characteristics.
 Together, we have engaged privately with NN Group’s management over several months and we remain of the view that NN Group is worth far more than the market currently ascribes. 
 The attractiveness of NN Group is rooted not only in the strength of its fundamental underlying business - exhibiting historically stable shareholder cash flows - but in its ability to successfully manage risk and deliver stable and sustainable results, irrespective of market volatility, including large changes in market interest rates and evolving regulatory environments. 
NN Group itself is the greatest impediment to unlocking the valuation discount
 Notwithstanding the above, the reason for publishing our presentation today is our strong belief that one of the key impediments to unlocking NN Group’s valuation discount lies in the Company’s own inability to articulate its case to investors with clarity or conviction. 
 For years, NN Group has traded well below its intrinsic value, and more recently, poorly relative to its peers when it should in fact trade at a premium. 
 In a recent shareholder survey, we found a vast majority (>75% of respondents) did not understand NN Group’s interest-rate exposure, while >65% did not understand the Company’s progressive dividend policy. 
 A further >75% majority expressed support for increased asset optimisation, while >85% of participants did not understand why NN Group is present in various countries within the Insurance Europe business, and would support a strategic review. 
 Notably, NN Group management has responded that it is either “difficult to say” or “difficult to predict” in response to analysts’ questions on recent investor calls far more frequently than its European insurance peers.1 Investors and other market participants are left confused, struggling to understand NN Group’s fundamental business qualities, and unable to appreciate its balance sheet strengths and underlying cash-flow generation capabilities. 
 In short, there are compelling fundamentals as well as a vast array of value-creation levers at the Company’s disposal that NN Group has failed to properly set out and explain. 
 This lack of transparency and insufficient disclosure around fundamentals such as NN Group’s interest rate exposure comes at a significant price: it has led the market to assign a material discount to NN Group’s share price, which is unwarranted in Elliott’s view. 
Elliott believes NN Group’s upcoming Capital Markets Day (“CMD”) on 24 June provides an opportune moment for management to address its persistent undervaluation and growing investor discontent.
 Elliott believes this year’s CMD is the time for NN Group to hold itself accountable, reset its trajectory and communicate not only the basic fundamentals of the business but the many optimisation levers available to unlock the Company’s significant potential. 
Asset optimisation: NN Group has one of the lowest risk asset portfolios of any life entity in the European insurance sector.
 This gives NN Group the opportunity to take advantage of market dislocations and to increase its exposure to private assets, with an opportunity to sustainably increase cash flows by EUR 175 million. 
 Dutch market leadership: With the acquisition of Delta Lloyd and VIVAT complete, NN Group has become the undisputed No. 1 insurance provider in the Netherlands. 
NN Group has ample capacity to enter into more longevity swap transactions and could generate surplus capital of up to EUR 1.9 billion.
 Footprint optimisation: NN Group’s large collection of disparate standalone businesses are ripe for rationalisation – operational improvements, reinsurance transactions and outright business sales could generate substantial value for the Company’s shareholders. 
 In summary, the CMD offers NN Group the opportunity to highlight its underappreciated strengths, showcase its robust financial profile, set itself ambitious but achievable cash generation, capital release and capital return targets that collectively demonstrate confidence and conviction in the business, and most importantly, show a willingness to be held accountable for the Company’s future development. 
 Given the Company’s strengths and prospects, there is no reason in our view why NN Group cannot be a standout performer. 
 Elliott believes if NN Group were to adopt these recommendations, it would offer a pathway forward to a materially higher share price – with upside potential of over 80% in the next few years – and the opportunity to establish itself as the leading steward of shareholder capital in the European insurance sector. 
 Such a result would not only boost NN Group’s market value, but also boost the reputation of NN Group’s management and entire team for showing strong leadership at a time of wider market uncertainty. 
NN Group would finally – and rightly – be recognised and rewarded as one of the most attractive and differentiated insurance investments in Europe.
1 Elliott has undertaken a statistical word-count analysis of more than 1.2 million words to compare NN Group’s communications on recent investor calls to those of other European insurance providers.
The Supervisory Board of NN Group has decided to nominate Inga Beale for appointment as member of NN Group's Supervisory Board for a term of four years.

It's no secret that getting a face lift is a major commitment.
 Recovery takes weeks, face lifts are one of the most expensive cosmetic procedures, and they create a lasting change to your face. 
But there are a number of less intense options for those who are looking to tighten and lift facial skin without going under the knife.
Thread lifts are one such alternative.
   The thread lift is a minimally-invasive, surgical procedure that is designed to alleviate the facial skin and soft tissue laxity that typically develop with age,   says Konstantin Vasyukevich, M.D., double board-certified plastic surgeon at New York Facial Plastic Surgery. 
 Depending on the area of the face or neck being treated, providers will choose from relatively smooth threads to larger barbed threads which can create maximal lifting but aren't ideal for areas with thinner skin, such as the forehead, says Dr. Lee. 
 Thread lifts are most commonly used to lift jowls (aka loose skin underneath the chin), but brow, neck, or cheek thread lifts are also common, says Dr. Vasyukevich. 
 As with many cosmetic treatments, thread lifts are offered by a range of medical practitioners, but be cognizant of choosing the appropriate provider to perform such a delicate treatment. 
 After all, the procedure involves the use of needles and sutures, so the American Med Spa Association's stance is that only people with registered nurse-level or higher training should offer thread lifts. 
 What's more,   over the years, the thread lift has evolved to do more than just tighten the skin,   says Dr. Lee. 
 The insertion of a foreign object (in this case the thread), triggers your body to go into repair mode while creating a temporary lift. 
What are the pros and cons of thread lifts?
One of the perks of thread lifts compared to some of the more invasive cosmetic procedures is that they can be performed under local anesthesia during a brief office visit.
 Thread lifts can cause bruising or swelling, and it may take a few days - or up a week with maximal lifting - to get the final, most natural, appearance, says Dr. Lee. 
 If you've seen a thread lift before and after post on Instagram and thought that the result looked highly unnatural, it may have been taken immediately following the procedure. 
 That said, if you want to avoid the downtime involved with a more serious surgery such as a traditional face lift, the thread lift might suit you. 
 Another advantage is that thread lifts can be reversed; If you don't like the results, you can ask your provider to remove the thread rather than waiting months for it to dissolve. 
 The typical thread lift cost ranges from $4,000 to $6,000, according to Dr. Vasyukevich, so they're not exactly cheap, especially if you plan to get them repeatedly. 
 In the absence of complications, thread lifts look and feel relatively undetectable. 
 Realistically though, some results can only be achieved with a surgical face lift. 
   If someone just has a sag to their skin, then thread lift can achieve a significant improvement,   says Dr. Lee. 
 People who are just starting to show signs of aging will have sagging at a superficial level that can be addressed with a thread lift, but for people who are older and have sagging at a deeper level, a thread lift won't have much of a visible result, he explains. 
 Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said:   We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy.   
 According to the veteran midfielder, Henderson wanted someone to lift the trophy with him after Liverpool won the 2019 Champions League Final, and Milner was his first choice. 
 “He was asking someone else to lift the trophy with him and it was like: ‘No Hendo, this is your moment and you’ve earned the right, you deserve the right to go along with the other captains who have done it and go down in history for this club,’” said Milner. 
He also made sure the captain didn’t try to recruit someone else to lift the trophy alongside him.
 It’s all our moment, him lifting the trophy, but every single player would have wanted him to lift it and lift it on his own. 
I think my words were something like: ‘If someone else lifts it with you I’ll rugby tackle them off the stage!’”

 The Air Force is looking beyond the venerable C-130 for tactical airlift missions, saying the airplane no longer meets its needs for a future of dispersed operating locations where a runway may not be available. 
 Gen. S. Clinton Hinote told the House Armed Services seapower and projection forces panel the Air Force no longer views the C-130 as “well suited” to the future tactical airlift mission, and it needs to replace it with “new capabilities” involving vertical lift technologies. 
 “There’s been a lot of discussion about tactical airlift in the future, and I think it’s important for me, as the Air Force’s futurist, to say something about it,” said Hinote, whose title is deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration, and requirements. 
 In wargaming scenarios with China, and given the Air Force’s plan to island- and location-hop to avoid enemy missiles, “we run significant risk in [tactical] airlift, especially in conducting logistics under attack,” Hinote said. 
 “That’s why we feel we need to retire a certain number of the older C-130s, while addressing this airlift risk in new ways, with new capabilities.” 
 In scenarios where logistics is under attack by China, Russia, or other adversaries, “what we see is that the capability for vertical lift is going to be really important for us; i.e., getting away from the fixed runway, so that we can do logistics in a way that is somewhat disruptive, and, frankly, a lot harder to target.” 
Hinote said there are “quite a few efforts going on” with regard to battlefield vertical lift.
 The Army is pursuing a number of new rotary-craft programs, which Hinote said the Air Force is “following very closely,” but “at the very same time, we’re exploring vertical lift programs inside of our RDT&E as well.” 
 In recent years, contractors have shown a variety of vertical-lift or short takeoff/vertical landing concepts for a future battlefield, from quad-tiltrotors to stealthy tactical transports with lift fans in their wings. 
Some have also promoted a new generation of airships for the lift mission; all oriented toward a future that weans the Air Force off long runways.
 In a nod to the members’ concerns, Hinote said this new capability “may be a very important part of the reserve component, because the idea of vertical lift could also play a huge role in some of the responsibilities that …governors have” for humanitarian and disaster relief. 
 However, he quickly added that “we’ve got to look beyond, in lift, especially tactical lift; we’ve got to look to the future. 
 The Air Force’s vertical-lift portfolio includes the CV-22 tiltrotor, used for special operations missions; HH-60G and HH-60W helicopters, used for combat search and rescue; UH-1N helicopters for VIP transport and missile field support and security; and the new MH-139 Grey Wolf, which will replace the UH-1N.

 Despite much fanfare over its rapid vaccination program and the unlocking of coronavirus restrictions in recent months, the U.K. could be about to delay its much-vaunted lifting of all lockdown measures in England on June 21. 
 The U.K. government is expected to decide over the next few days whether to delay the lifting of restrictions in England on June 21, which had been   Freedom Day   and the date when the government hoped to   be in a position to remove all legal limits on social contact.   
   Step 4   of the lifting of restrictions is meant to see more premises allowed to reopen, including nightclubs, and restrictions on large events and performances removed. 
 But several high profile officials and health experts have signaled that the government could, and should, delay the June 21 lifting given the spread of the Delta variant which has provoked a sharp uptick in infections.

The popular motorhome rental company Camptoo researched barbecues throughout the UK to discover what trends will define this grilling season.
 The research was conducted by motorhome rental company, Camptoo, which ranked UK campsites on popularity, weather, air quality and nearby landmarks. 
 Ed Bassett, Camptoo’s Head of Wanderlust, said on the research: “This was a really interesting piece of research to be involved with and it gave us some very unexpected results. 
 New research from leading motorhome rental company, Camptoo, has ranked the 10 top camping hotspots in the UK, with Higher Moor Farm in Dorset taking the top spot.

 This is where Camptoo, the global recreational vehicle sharing service online booking platform, comes in handy. 
 Founded in The Netherlands in 2014, Camptoo provides something to suit all users from solo travellers, gap-yearers, career breakers, families and couples. 
 In all, Camptoo, offers over 4,000 campervans, caravans and motorhomes to rent directly from vehicle owners. 
 “We are excited to see Australian’s embracing the Camptoo lifestyle, as we know how truly passionate Australians are about their travel outdoors. 
 Carla Dichiera, Director of Camptoo Australia 
 Owners list their vehicle on the Camptoo website along with important information such as location, number of seats, beds, availability and whether the vehicle can be dropped off or needs to be collected etc. 
 All vehicles are comprehensively insured to allow both owner and renter a carefree holiday, with Camptoo providing all the necessary paperwork and checklists. 
 The latest research released by British motorhome rental company Camptoo revealed that wellness, activity and camping retreats have seen a sharp rise in online searches in the past few years. 
 Activity retreats are among the fastest growing in the industry, after experiencing a 928 per cent increase in online searches from 2019 to 2020 before peaking in March-May, and Camptoo’s head of wanderlust, Ed Bassett, is expecting a similar uptake in interest this year as the UK gradually begins to ease out of lockdown. 
 Adventure tours firm Call to Adventure, which has partnered with Camptoo, is one of the companies anticipating a surge in interest in the coming months – particularly after seeing the online search trends favour their services so heavily. 
 According to motorhome rental company Camptoo, investing in eco-friendly products which you can take with you on the road is the best way to make the most of the outdoors.. 
 “It’s wonderful to see so many people take an interest in the environment and actively looking for ways to improve how they live and travel,” says Camptoo’s Head of Wanderlust, Ed Basset, about the growing trend.

 This outreach includes the website BlackFolksCampToo.com, which offers information on how to camp, and Facebook and YouTube channels that show camping in a fresh light. 
 Ed Bassett of Camptoo suggests campers consider heading away from the obvious areas: “Campsites in the traditionally popular tourist areas such as Cornwall, Devon, north-west Wales and western Scotland have been very busy recently. 
 Camptoo has around 600 UK van-share listings, again with a vast array of styles and sizes (from £50 a night). 
 Motorhome and campervan rental platform, Camptoo, provide the ultimate romantic list for couples to check out post-lockdown: 
 The Catbells walk is rated as the most popular walk for loved-up duos on TripAdvisor and could be the first place to check out for couples when the travel restrictions are limited, with over 100 available to pitch up with your Camptoo campervan. 
 Due to its location, Rhinefield Ornamental Drive is not the best place on the list if you want to star-gaze – it has fewer minutes than anywhere else – but with 46 campsites in the area, you’re never too far away and it could be the perfect spot to take your Camptoo campervan for a post-lockdown break.

 It's also worth putting together a detailed itinerary of what you'd like to do at your destination and calling each operator to see whether they'll be able to accommodate you.Consider accommodation just outside the popular hotspots (not only do they tend to be easier on the hip pocket but you're likely to find greater availability) and vehicles that are a little less conventional, such as Juicy or Camptoo. 
   This depends on the individual campsite so it is worth checking the facilities before you book,   explained Ed Bassett, UK Country Manager at Camptoo.

 Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist, was lawfully killed on London Bridge by armed police after stabbing two people at a prisoner rehabilitation event while wearing a fake suicide belt, an inquest jury has concluded. 
 The inquest heard six officers from the Metropolitan police and City of London police had fired 20 times at Khan, including 18 times in a 90-second period after being sanctioned to carry out a “critical shot” amid fears he was about to detonate his explosive device resulting in mass casualties. 
 After a two-week inquest at the City of London’s Guildhall, half a mile from where Khan died, jurors concluded on Thursday that Khan had been lawfully killed by anonymous police officers. 
 Last month a separate inquest found that failures by MI5, the police and the probation service in the run-up to the attack all contributed to their deaths of Jones and Merritt. 
 A mother and three of her children died when their family car collided with an oncoming lorry, an inquest has heard. 
The inquest heard how the crash happened when the Subaru swerved into the path of a fully-laden Renault 480 lorry on the opposite side of the road.
 In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Powell, a railway engineer, said he had no memory of the crash. 
The inquest heard Penny was thrown out of the car by the impact of the collision and was found crying on the ground by drivers who had stopped after the crash.
 An investigation did not find any issues with Patricio’s driving before the collision and there was no clear reason why the Subaru swerved into the path of his lorry, the inquest heard. 
 The improper use of a spit hood could have left an Indigenous man, Wayne Fella Morrison, struggling to breathe and may have contributed to his death, according to a pathologist giving evidence to an inquest on Tuesday into his death. 
 Dr Cheryl Charlwood had told the inquest last week that while no one single condition caused the death of the 29-year-old Wiradjuri, Kokatha and Wirangu man, five factors had contributed: physical exertion, acute psychological stress, excited delirium, genetic susceptibility and a “potential positional element”. 
 There was a possibility the foster father who murdered Gold Coast schoolgirl Tiahleigh Palmer sexually abused her before her death, an inquest has been told. 
 There was a possibility the foster father who murdered Tiahleigh Palmer sexually abused her before her death, an inquest has been told. 
 He also told the inquest he was   coerced into pleading guilty   earlier to multiple charges of sexual assault for offences unrelated to Tiahleigh. 
 Despite internal reviews and criminal trials, no one knows what happened to Tiahleigh in her final moments, a pre-inquest hearing was told last month. 
 Trent Thorburn, the foster brother of murdered schoolgirl Tiahleigh Palmer, is seen departing the Brisbane Coroners Court after the inquest. 
Inquest findings are expected to be handed down next week.
 David Kuzmeski, an associate professor of criminal justice at American International College, said Miller's family and advocates could also obtain some of the answers they're looking for through an official inquest. 
 Inquests are a process in which a judge hears all of the evidence through testimony — similar to the grand jury process but independent of those criminal proceedings — and makes a determination of whether the cause of death   was criminal or not,   Kuzmeski said. 
 Massachusetts law has long permitted medical examiners, district attorneys and attorneys general to order these inquests, but they're infrequently used because most cases are   readily resolvable   through a grand jury, according to Kuzmeski. 
Why do you have an inquest?
 Kuzmeski said he'd advocate for an inquest to be ordered in the Miller case — and be used more frequently overall — because they not only provide   an objective second look at all the evidence,   but also allow family members to sit in on the process as well as review information normally withheld or kept under seal during active cases. 
THE SISTER of George Nkencho is calling on the public to show support for her family when the formal inquest into his death begins later this month.
A formal inquest into his death is due to being on June 21 in the RDS in Dublin.
 This week his sister, Gloria Nkencho, took to social media to call on supporters to attend a rally outside the RDS during the inquest. 
 In a post titled   Support the Nkencho Family at Inquest   she wrote:   We appeal to all organisations, to young people, students, parents, trade unionists, political parties, organisations within the black and minority communities: stand with us to call for justice and truth - for a full and thorough investigation into the shooting dead of our brother and son, George.   
   The inquest will then adjourn, pending the outcome of all legal investigations. 
 The inquest into George's death is an occasion when all who want justice and a public inquiry, we must peacefully demonstrate that. 
 Firearms officers were trained to take a   head shot   at terrorists who might blow themselves up, the inquest into the shooting of the Fishmongers' Hall killer has heard. 
 The firearms officers had to kill Khan, eight minutes after he was struck at close range, to allow paramedics to reach the injured inside the building, the officer told the inquest. 
 The   critical shot   could be taken without specific authorisation from above to do so, the inquest heard. 
 He told the inquest:   It is very challenging to differentiate. 
 Mr Taylor told the inquest:   In those circumstances, I would expect the officer and or commander to consider a critical shot.   
 Murdered Queensland schoolgirl Tiahleigh Palmer was not only sexually abused by her foster brother, but was likely also abused by her foster dad, an inquest has been told. 
Rick Thorburn – who was jailed for life in 2018 for murdering Tiahleigh – stunned the inquest on Tuesday when he tearfully claimed he may have accidentally smothered the 12-year-old in October 2015 during an argument.
 As the inquest wrapped up on Wednesday, counsel assisting the coroner Kate McMahon explosively told the court it could be inferred that Thorburn sexually abused Tiahleigh and her murder could have been to cover up not only step brother Trent's actions, but his own. 
 The two-day inquest has been rocked by evidence from Thorburn, who spoke for the first time about what he says happened the night he killed her. 
The inquest into Tiahleigh Palmer's death is examining how the 12-year-old died at the hands of her foster father Rick Thorburn and how he disposed of her body.
McMahon said a recorded prison phone call between Thorburn and his wife suggested a deliberate plan to claim a lack of memory in order to frustrate the inquest.
   That remorselessness has also been evident in his behaviour towards this inquest.   
 The inquest also heard from Thorburn's wife, Julene, who said she still visited him behind bars and remained married to him. 
 A schoolboy who “had his whole life ahead of him” died in hospital nearly three weeks after being found seriously ill near a playing field, an inquest heard. 
 An inquest into the death of 11-year-old Dylan Afandi at Newport Civic Centre on Thursday heard that he was discovered on a mountain path near Brynithel rugby pitch on Penrhiw Estate in Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, at around 6.15pm on May 11 last year. 
 The inquest heard that Ms Morris had not seen her son since June 16, 2016, and was not aware of where he was living or what he was doing with Dylan’s father granted full custody after they separated. 
Why we cover inquests – and why it's so important that we do As painful as these proceedings are for those who have lost a loved one the lessons that can be learned from inquests can go a long way to saving others’ lives.
The press has a legal right to attend inquests and has a responsibility to report on them as part of their duty to uphold the principle of open justice.
An inquest report can also clear up any rumours or suspicion surrounding a person’s death.
 But, most importantly of all, an inquest report can draw attention to circumstances which may stop further deaths from happening. 
Should journalists shy away from attending inquests then an entire arm of the judicial system is not held to account.
 Inquests can often prompt a wider discussion on serious issues, the most recent of these being mental health and suicide. 
Editors actively ask and encourage reporters to speak to the family and friends of a person who is the subject of an inquest.
Without the attendance of the press at inquests questions will remain unanswered and lives will be lost.
The inquest heard that Dylan had previously lived in Newquay where he attended primary school before moving with his family to the Trinant area and starting high school.
 Of the first inquest, Alex says:   If you read back over the conclusions, it looks like Hayden was only six days old, was quite ill, he got appropriate care and he couldn't have been saved.   
 June 9, 2021 – Santiago, Chile-based inQuest Consultores has merged with Atlanta-based The ExeQfind Group. 
 Launched in 2002, inQuest serves both the professional and technical recruitment space as well as retained executive search in both Chile and other countries within Latin America. 
The merger leverages almost a decade of collaboration between inQuest and both The QualiFind Group and The ExeQfind Group (The ExeQfind Group’s sister practice) and further strengthens our capacity to serve clients from North America to South America.
 “Boutique recruiting firms are well positioned to provide talent acquisition services across the geography of Latin America,” said Mariela Brasca, senior recruiter at inQuest. 
 However the statement of a close friend, who the inquest heard had known Bradley from a young age, spoke of bullying, saying that it had got worse as they had got older, and stating that Bradley had given up reporting it because the school did not try to stop it. 
 A woman was killed by an overhanging tree branch when she stuck her head out of a window of a moving train, an inquest jury has concluded. 
 The inquest heard that after the death of a passenger leaning out a window on a train in south London in August 2016, GWR completed a risk assessment of its droplight windows. 
 The inquest heard that the tree had undergone inspections in 2009 and 2012 as part of a five-year cycle by Network Rail, which was responsible for the management of trackside vegetation. 
 Following five days of evidence, the inquest jury returned a narrative conclusion by a majority.

 RWE is delivering the test site in partnership with Ampyx Power, a Dutch company that is developing the innovative wind energy technology. 
 Ampyx Power, founded in 2009, is one of the leading companies in the emerging Airborne Wind Energy sector. 
 Fabrizio Nastri, CEO of Ampyx Power said: “After 12 years of hard work and multiple generations of smaller prototypes, we are excited to start operating our technology demonstrator on a 150 kW scale in Ireland in a real operational environment. 
The company is partnering on the initiative with airborne wind energy technology developer Ampyx Power of the Netherlands.
 “After 12 years of hard work and multiple generations of smaller prototypes, we are excited to start operating our technology demonstrator on a 150 kW scale in Ireland in a real operational environment,” commented Ampyx Power chief executive Fabrizio Nastri. 
 Plans about the test site in Ireland and the tie-up with Ampyx Power were announced in 2017 by E.on SE (ETR:EOAN), before the latter’s asset swap deal with RWE. 
 We wish RWE all the best during the construction phase and developing the AWES technology to commercial scale.  RWE's test site will first undertake testing, verification and demonstration of a 150 kilowatts (kW) demonstrator system developed by partner Ampyx Power, followed later by a larger commercial-scale 1 megawatt (MW) system.

 Ampyx Power, a start-up in the Netherlands, developed an aircraft with a 40-foot wingspan that generates electricity by being catapulted into the air and flying while attached to the ground with a cable. 
 Ampyx Power, a Dutch developer of Airborne Wind Energy Systems, a next generation of wind energy technology allowing low-cost production of renewable energy, today announced a cooperation with the German utility E.ON. 
 In addition, Ampyx Power launches a new crowdfunding campaign aimed at raising investments of € 2.5 million. 
Ampyx Power and E.ON have entered into a cooperation aiming at furthering Ampyx Power’s Airborne Wind Energy technology into commercial deployment.
 The test site will be used by Ampyx Power for testing, verification and demonstration of the continuous operation of Ampyx Power’s fully functional technology demonstrator, and its subsequent 2 MW Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES). 
Ampyx Power’s 2 MW AWES will be tailored to repower the first-generation offshore wind parks once the service life has come to an end.
The testing at the E.ON test site is an important stepping stone towards subsequent offshore demonstration and eventually commercial deployment of Ampyx Power’s AWES and follow-up products.
Ampyx Power has started construction of its fully functional demonstrator in 2016.
 In order to finance activities towards commercialisation of its technology, Ampyx Power aspires to enlarge its current base of informal investors with a new crowdfunding campaign targeting investments of € 2.5 million. 
Investments can be made through the investor portal on Ampyx Power’s website.
 Since Ampyx Power’s first crowdfunding campaign in 2013, about 400 informal investors have invested over € 4 million. 
 While in principle we are technology agnostic, we consider this cooperation with Ampyx Power a major step in our efforts to take a leading role in furthering the promising emerging Airborne Wind Energy sector.” 
 Ampyx Power, founded in 2009, is one of the leading companies in the emerging Airborne Wind Energy sector. 
 Wolbert Allaart, Managing Director of Ampyx Power: “This cooperation with E.ON, one of the leading energy companies in the world, is a major milestone for our company. 
Ampyx Power develops fixed wing Airborne Wind Energy Systems for deployment in utility-scale wind parks.
 Ampyx Power is a frontrunner in the emerging airborne wind energy industry, through its clear focus on system safety and reliability. 
 Ampyx Power has held approvals from airspace authorities to operate its prototypes since 2010, and plays a key role in the development of the regulatory framework and certification standards for airborne wind energy systems. 
 Ampyx Power has been funded with support from the European Commission, Horizon 2020 SME Instrument (grant no. 666793 – AMPYXAP3) 
 The European Space Agency (ESA) has funded Ampyx Power, developer of a next-generation wind energy technology, and Omnisense, developer of locating and tracking solutions, to develop a robust fail-safe navigation system. 
The positioning solution will be used for automated take-off and landing of Ampyx Power’s wind-energy aircraft when applied offshore or over rugged terrain.
Ampyx Power develops airborne wind energy systems (AWES) using autonomous tethered aircraft as a means for generating electricity on the ground.
 “The project allows us to integrate a backup local positioning system into the existing high-end navigation solution,” said Michiel Kruijff, head of technology at Ampyx Power. 
The Dutch Topsector Energie-TKI Wind op Zee recently awarded a subsidy to Dutch wind energy technology developer Ampyx Power and the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR).
The AWES being developed by Ampyx Power is a compact system that uses the strong winds prevailing at altitudes above 200 metres.
 The research being undertaken by NLR and Ampyx Power is aimed at the development of the AP4 aircraft model, the commercial successor to the AP3 prototype currently being built by Ampyx Power. 
 Also racing to market is another Dutch company, Ampyx Power, which hopes to start testing a precommercial demonstrator at the end of this year before embarking on further tests at RWE’s onshore high-wind test site in Ireland in 2021. 
 Another airborne energy contender, the Dutch Ampyx Power, won the backing of European energy giant E.ON, which in 2017 committed to test Ampyx’s 2MW Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) at a test site it was developing in Ireland. 
 Wind turbine towers have become a familiar sight in many parts of the world, but if Ampyx Power has its way, they could be replaced with fleets of tethered drones. 
 In contrast, Ampyx Power wants to go after the high-wind altitudes above 200 m (660 ft) by means of large, tethered drones that would be connected to the ground by special lines linked to a winch. 
The video below explains the Ampyx Power system.
 A second Netherlands-based start-up, Ampyx Power, is developing a tethered aircraft that can take off and land on floating platforms far out to sea. 
 The crosswind devices at (among others) Ampyx Power, EnerKite, Kitepower, Kitemill, SkySails Power and TwingTec all produce electricity in this fashion. 
 All these advantages come at a price, and Ruiterkamp of Ampyx Power sums it up well. 
 Michiel Kruijff, head of technology at Ampyx Power, explained that its kite stores energy on board so it can fly back to its platform if its tether breaks. 
 In addition to Makani, several other start-ups are competing in the airborne wind energy sector, including EnerKite, Skypull and Ampyx Power. 
 Pim Breukelman, commercial director of Ampyx Power 
Another team betting on airborne wind is Ampyx Power from the Netherlands.
 But Ampyx Power’s craft takes off with a catapult from the ground, and looks more like an aircraft. 
 ‘This is a whole new generation of wind-energy technology,’ said Pim Breukelman, commercial director of Ampyx Power. 
 The designs of Ampyx Power and Skypull might look wildly different, but both work according to similar principles. 
 Ampyx Power will test their ninth prototype at the end of the year in Spain, which will be followed by tests in Ireland. 
 Yet for all the advantages of the airborne version, Skypull and Ampyx Power don’t want to replace regular wind energy. 
 In many ways, the story of Ampyx Power is a classic start-up tale, beginning with a flash of inspiration to reaching financial backing, via a stint in a university lab. 
 As research progressed, Richard Ruiterkamp – the eventual founder of Ampyx Power – joined the team, honing the technology from a kite-based to a fixed-wing product. 
 The team began to see the commercial viability of the technology they were developing, and eventually, Ampyx Power was spun out from the university in 2008. 
   We are set to disrupt the energy market,   says the director of Ampyx Power, WolbertAllaart. 
   In the future, our Ampyx Power parks will provide abundant renewable energy at market utility scale, at cost levels below any other method of electricity generation.   
 Founder of Ampyx Power, Richard Ruiterkamp, says it’s all down the amount of materials required. 
Ampyx Power has finished the conceptual and preliminary design phase and is in the construction drawing stage.
 Ampyx Power says that, in the unlikely event of a tether break, the PowerPlane’s automatic security mechanism allows the plane to land safely. 
 Ampyx Power is actively partnering with environmental consultancies to carry out impact studies on noise, bird strikes, and flora and fauna. 
 Along similar lines to Ampyx Power’s PowerPlanes, Makani is a tethered kite-type system. 
 The journey is ongoing and Ampyx Power is highly aware that commercial viability is not the holy grail, but convincing people to buy the system is. 
 The German utility, which has also entered into an agreement with Dutch firm Ampyx Power to be the first user of the demonstration site, said construction of the facility opened up possibilities for collaboration with a range of companies pioneering airborne wind power generation technology. 
Ampyx Power intends to fly its Airborne Wind Energy Systems at high-wind altitudes above 200m to turn winches on the ground that will generate electricity.
 Working with partner Omnisense, a Cambridgeshire-based developer of locating and tracking solutions, the positioning solution will be used for automated take-off and landing of Ampyx Power’s wind energy aircraft when applied offshore or over rugged terrain. 
 According to Ampyx Power, the aircraft launch and landing deck is smaller than the wingspan of the aircraft. 
 In a statement, Michiel Kruijff, Head of Technology at Ampyx Power: “The project allows us to integrate a backup local positioning system into the existing high-end navigation solution. 
One company that seems to have an early lead on airborne wind is Ampyx Power.
 Make no mistake; what Ampyx Power is doing is absolutely game changing, and you can be certain we’ll be looking to wet our beaks on this opportunity as it develops. 
The firm also entered a collaboration agreement with Netherlands-based airborne wind energy firm Ampyx Power.
 Drones could fly on the end of tethers to generate electricity on the ground as they twist and turn in the wind, according to Ampyx Power. 
A model of a windborne energy system from Ampyx Power.
 In cooperation with Ampyx Power, a Dutch manufacturer of airborne wind systems, E.ON plans to carry out initial tests this year. 
 Airborne wind turbine (AWT) technologies are being developed by a few firms, such as Altaeros Energies Inc and Ampyx Power. 
 Another system with active launch is that designed by Ampyx Power, a Dutch company. 
 Elsewhere, companies such as Kitenergy, SkySails Power and Ampyx Power are also developing their own various types of AWES. 
 It was the brainchild of Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, previously the founder of green energy company Ampyx Power. 
 That’s far cheaper than current offshore wind power in Europe and would make it extremely competitive with power produced from coal and natural gas.Another company close to actual wind farm development is Ampyx Power, based in the Netherlands and spun out of research at Delft University. 
 Dr Ruiterkamp said that the “PowerPlanes” which his company, Ampyx Power, is testing in the Netherlands, use autonomous drones to fly. 
 A mechanical engineer by training, Lansdorp sold most of his stake in Ampyx Power, an airborne wind-energy company he founded in 2011, to get the start-up capital to jump-start this space initiative. 
 There are also two kite-like competitors, by KiteGen and NTS X-Wind, and the PowerPlane by Ampyx Power. 
 Recent investments in European airborne wind energy companies have also added momentum to the industry, including 3M’s funding of Nature Technology Systems, DSM Venturing’s funding of SkySails, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines’ funding of Ampyx Power, and Sabic Ventures’ funding of KiteGen.

 To do this, we need a common approach to measuring our impact and using data, as we have done before in the climate debate,” says Roel Nozeman, Senior Biodiversity Advisor at ASN Bank and Chair of PBAF. 
ASN Bank heads new biodiversity accounting initiative
 ASN Bank has convened a group of fellow Dutch financial institutions – including ACTIAM, FMO, Robeco and Triodos Bank – to develop a common accounting measure for the positive biodiversity impacts of their investments. 
The Partnership Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF) initiative was unveiled this week and mirrors the successful carbon accounting initiative (PCAF) that ASN Bank set up in 2015.
 Biodiversity is an issue ASN Bank, which is part of the De Volksbank group, has been focusing on for a number of years: In 2016, it included biodiversity as one of its three sustainability pillars – joining climate change and human rights – and committed to having a net positive biodiversity impact by 2030. 
 But Roel Nozeman, Senior Advisor Biodiversity at ASN Bank, told RI that every company it has assessed to date has a “net negative impact on biodiversity”, highlighting the challenge the 2030 pledge poses. 
   We can’t wait for perfect data, there is a crisis going on   - Roel Nozeman, ASN Bank 
ASN Bank has measured its own biodiversity footprint every year since it undertook a pilot in 2016 with consultants PRé Sustainability and CREM.
This raw data – which goes down to sector level – is translated by ASN Bank into an indicator of the biodiversity loss it is responsible for.
 In January, a report by PwC and WWF on biodiversity, which referred to the issue as the “next frontier in financial risk management”, described ASN Bank as “leading the way” on sustainability. 
 ASN Bank is also involved in the Dutch central bank’s own working group on biodiversity, leading an globally-focused workstream looking at tools and reporting on deforestation. 
 The Volksbank group, which includes SNS, ASN Bank and Regiobank, is cutting its workforce by 400 to 500 jobs over the coming three years. 
 Symbiotics, a market-access platform for impact investing, arranged for this bond’s issuance in partnership with Netherland’s sustainable banking majors, Triodos Bank and ASN Bank. 
 The founding partners of PBAF are ASN Bank (part of de Volksbank), ACTIAM, FMO, Robeco, Triodos Bank and Triple Jump. 
 The initiative, which was set up in 2018 by a number of Dutch asset managers and banks including ASN Bank and Robeco, aims to encourage financial institutions to measure their impact on biodiversity, report on this in a transparent way and set targets to improve their ecological footprint. 
 The institutions that have signed up to PBAF are “showing their commitment to actively pursuing a shared methodology for measuring and reporting the impact of their loans and investments on biodiversity,” said Roel Nozeman, senior advisor biodiversity at ASN Bank and chair of the partnership.

 De Volksbank is reorganizing and will be cutting 400 to 500 jobs in the coming three years, the financial group behind SNS, ASN Bank, RegioBank and BLG Wonen announced on Friday. 
 Elsewhere, ASN Bank is spearheading a Dutch initiative with Actiam, FMO, Robeco and Triodos Bank called the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials, which aims to develop a common accounting measure for the positive biodiversity impacts of their investments. 
 ASN Bank changed up the financial world with their new campaign that demonstrates, in a playful way, how money can actually make you happy. 
 The financial world is all too often represented in a cliché image, so enough reason for ASN Bank to change it up to a more contemporary one. 
 Because ASN Bank is very focused on sustainability, it was very important for us to translate that passion into the film. 
 “For us it was an obvious choice to not create the forest in 3D, but to make it a reference to the real life ‘Forest of Ideals’ planted by the ASN Bank customers. 
 The Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials was formed in 2019 by founding partners ASN Bank (part of de Volksbank), ACTIAM, FMO, Robeco, Triodos Bank and Triple Jump. 
 Roel Nozeman, Senior Advisor Biodiversity at ASN Bank and chairman of the partnership, is excited about the new partners joining the platform. 
 PCAF is led by a Steering Committee comprised largely of PCAF’s founding members, which include: ABN AMRO, Amalgamated Bank, ASN Bank, The Global Alliance for Banking on Values, Morgan Stanley, NMB Bank Limited, and Triodos Bank. 
 The product covers a huge part of the Dutch market with its more than 17 million citizens as customers from banks like ING, Rabobank, ASN Bank, SNS, RegioBank and Bunq can also use the app for their current accounts. 
 Dorine Putman-Devilee, institutional relations manager at the Netherlands-based ASN Bank, which specializes in socially responsible and sustainable investments, said she was worried that an over-emphasis on providing credit could entice people into debt. 
 Other committee members include ABN Amro Bank, Amalgamated Bank and ASN Bank. 
 Piet Sprengers, Manager of Sustainability Strategy at Dutch bank ASN Bank, describes the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) as “almost the perfect example of a bottom up process”. 
 The Instant Payments option is now available to customers of ING, ABN Amro, Rabobank, SNS, ASN Bank, RegioBank, and Knab. 
 Included on the Illinois list is ASN Bank of the Netherlands, which disinvested from a company building Jerusalem’s light rail but remains invested in at least one company, Electrocomponents of Britain, which operates inside Israel’s 1967 borders. 
 ASN Bank is a subsidiary of de Volksbank, the Netherlands’ fourth largest bank; it recently worked with CDC Biodiversité, Actiam and Finance in Motion to estimate the impact on biodiversity of its investments. 
 “In 2017, for example, we know we were responsible for a loss of 64.849 hectares of biodiversity,” says Roel Nozeman, senior adviser on biodiversity at ASN Bank – probably the only person with such a title in the banking industry. 
He offers an illustration of how ASN Bank got to that figure using an investment in a Spanish shoe company as an example.
Nozeman says ASN Bank began asking itself where it wanted to be regarding biodiversity by 2030 back in 2014 because it understood the value.
He says ASN Bank would welcome incorporating biodiversity into the TCFD or creating a TNFD.
 Nozeman, who says that ASN Bank will begin to look at its loan portfolio next, also puts forward an idea that has drawn attention. 
 The ASN Bank report, entitled Living Wage in the Garment Sector: Results of the 2019 Reviews, said that Adidas was the only one of 13 brands to reach its 'leading' category. 
 For example, ASN Bank has declared they will have a positive effect on biodiversity by 2030, while Storebrand aims to have an investment portfolio that does not contribute to deforestation by 2025. 
 Payments through iDEAL are supported by 12 issuing banks and financial institutions: ABN Amro, ASN Bank, bunq, ING, Knab, Moneyou, Rabobank, RegioBank, SNS Bank, Svenska Handelsbanken, Triodos Bank, and Van Lanschot Bankiers. 
 The 26 brave institutions who have launched the Pledge are: ACTIAM N.V., Achmea Investment Management, AEGON Nederland N.V., Allianz France, ASN Bank, ASR Nederland, Bankinter, AXA Group, Caisse des Dépôts, Domini Impact Investments LLC, Etica Sgr - Responsible Investments, HSBC Global Asset Management, Karner Blue Capital, Mirova, Piraeus Bank, New Forests Pty Ltd, NN Investment Partners, NWB Bank, Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., Robeco, Triodos Bank, Triple Jump, UFF African Agri Investments, Vancity Investment Management and Volksbank. 
 Created from a merger of ING's Payconiq with loyalty platforms Qustomer and KBC’s CityLife, the all-in-one Payconiq app has drawn the added support of Belfius, AXA Bank and BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and four further Dutch banks - ASN Bank, Rabobank, Regiobank and SNS. 
 Over the past six months, ABN AMRO, ING, Rabobank, de Volksbank (ASN Bank, RegioBank, SNS) and Knab have gradually connected all their online and mobile banking customers to Instant Payments. 
 Several banks have an Android mobile app that supports NFC-enabled payments (ABN Amro, ING, Rabobank, ASN Bank, Bunq, often at a cost of 050€/month). 
 Regiobank is the best rated Dutch bank with a score of 9.3 out of 10, followed by ASN Bank on 9.1. 
 Six major Dutch banks – ABN Amro, ASN Bank, ING, Rabobank, Regiobank and SNS – have announced they will launch an all-in-one app this summer. 
 The piece, created for Dutch bank ASN Bank, which Ambassadors describes as “socially responsible and sustainable”, was inspired by an image of a seahorse that went viral. 
 Ambassadors creative director and partner, Vincent Lammers, adds: “ASN Bank’s fable storytelling world resonates with people old and young, and we were excited to add more characters. 
 How could we maintain the plush, inviting fable book animation of ASN Bank when everything is cool, wet and blue?” 
 The Volksbank (ASN Bank and SNS Bank), NIBC, Triodos Bank and Van Lanschot do not invest in firms with a poor reputation on animal welfare, the report said. 
 INFORM GmbH, a global company specializing in software that uses intelligent process optimization logic to improve business productivity, announces that RiskShield fraud prevention and detection solution has been selected and successfully implemented by Dutch bank and insurance group SNS REAAL, to provide real-time fraud detection for its 3 banking brand labels; SNS Bank, ASN Bank and RegioBank. 
 SNS REAAL is achieving a significant cost savings by eliminating traditional anti-fraud solutions and using RiskShield to monitor all domestic and international transactions for three banking brand labels; SNS Bank, ASN Bank and RegioBank, which manages millions of transactions per month. 
 ASN Bank has set a goal of having a net positive effect on biodiversity as a result of all of their loans and investments by 2030, and has worked with consultants to develop a tool to help them quantify their impacts on biodiversity. 
 Created from a merger of ING's Payconiq with loyalty platforms Qustomer and KBC’s CityLife, the all-in-one Payconiq app has drawn the added support of Belfius, AXA Bank and BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and four further Dutch banks - ASN Bank, Rabobank, Regiobank and SNS. 
 ABN Amro was just one of six major Dutch banks that was in on the Payconiq action, including SNS, Regiobank, Rabobank, ING and ASN Bank. 
 A consortium, including scientists, Van Oord wind park company and the ASN bank hope to launch another trial within several months, planting the colonies further away from the seabed. 
 Created from a merger of ING's Payconiq with loyalty platforms Qustomer and KBC’s CityLife, the all-in-one mobile app has drawn the support of Belfius in Belgian and five further Dutch banks - ABN Amro, ASN Bank, Rabobank, Regiobank and SNS - for a forthcoming roll out in the Netherlands. 
 The non-profit organisation, which works to promote and protect workers’ rights and improve workplace conditions, is to collaborate with ASN Bank on the move which will commit EUR15,000 (US$16,863) to the project. 
 It’s time to change that,” said Irina van der Sluijs, senior advisor for human rights at ASN Bank. 
 De Volksbank is a Dutch holding which has four distinctively positioned customer-oriented bank brands: ASN Bank, BLG Wonen, RegioBank and SNS, and is one of the first Dutch banks taking steps towards outsourcing their payments processing back-office. 
 ASN Bank, ING Bank, Rabobank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) provided debt financing. 
 The Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF) brings together Achmea Investment Management, ASN Bank, ASR Nederland, Kempen, MN, NN Investment Partners, Robeco and Triodos Investment Management, to “encourage, support and monitor” the companies they invest in to address living wage in their global supply chains.

 Payconiq reports it serves 60,000 merchants in these markets, and has bank shareholders that include Rabobank, ING, Regio Bank, SNS, Belfius, KBC Bank and ASN Bank. 
 Inspired by an earlier similar graphic from 2005, the infographic was put together for ASN Bank and Dutch energy consultant Ecofys. 
Nos quotes the case of Monique van Hoevelaak from Driebergen whose ASN bank account was frozen earlier this year because she is a ‘US person’.
 A great example is the ASN bank, which have committed to have a ‘Positive effect on biodiversity as a result of all of our loans and investments by 2030.’ 
 The next step is to evaluate whether the actions taken by companies like the ASN bank are achieving their goals, and helping the global challenge to halt the loss of biodiversity.“

 The former Olympian then booked a flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Istanbul on Monday after being denied access, according to the complaint. 
I knew none of this when I was handed a foil for the first time to face off with two-time Olympian James-Andrew Davis.
 The third Olympian is Gerek Meinhardt, who was the youngest male fencer in Team USA history when he competed in Beijing at age 18 (24 people who will make the trip to Tokyo in total). 
 He competed as an Olympian himself, led Team USA at three consecutive Olympics and even traveled the world as a fencing referee (which seems like a great concept for a TV show). 
 I’d planned to battle Alexander Massialas, Greg’s son and a 2021 Olympian (assuming the games go forward), but he received a last-minute invite to Los Angeles to train another amateur who is far more famous than me, so I “settled” for Davis, a two-time Olympian himself.

World Olympians Association awards financial support to inspirational Olympian-led initiatives
 Recipients will receive $5,000 funding to enhance their communities and the lives of fellow Olympians 
 World Olympians Association (WOA) has today announced the awardees of its WOA 2021 Service to Society and Service to Olympians Grants Programme, with ten Olympian-led initiatives receiving $5,000 each. 
 Split across all five continents, projects include using sport to integrate refugee children in Mali, upskilling Olympians with modern agriculture practices in Sri Lanka, preventing obesity by encouraging healthy lifestyles in Papua New Guinea and promoting sport as a tool of social cohesion in France. 
WOA’s grants will support National Olympians Associations (NOAs) and Olympians to spread the Olympic Values through implementing inspiring projects that create new opportunities in local communities or offer support to Olympians at every stage of their careers.
 2020 saw awardees adapt to the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and, overseen by their NOAs, Olympians have supported their communities by promoting sustainable environmental and healthy-living practices, launching cycling to school schemes for children and facilitating more opportunities for competitive sport in underprivileged areas. 
 World Olympians Association President and Chair of the Grants Panel, Joël Bouzou OLY, said: 
 “Awarding NOAs and supporting Olympian-led projects with our WOA Service to Olympians and Service to Society Grants is a highlight of our year and, as the world continues to endure the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, these initiatives are even more significant. 
 “Each year we see first-hand the direct, positive impact Olympians are able to make in their communities and for their fellow Olympians with this funding. 
We are very pleased to be able to help Olympians and NOAs across the world bring these inspirational projects to life.”
 Mali Olympians Association President, Abdoulaye Traoré OLY, said: 
 Sri Lanka Olympians Association President, Sriyani Kulawansa OLY, said: 
“Supporting the community of Olympians after their competitive career ends is a key focus of the Sri Lanka Olympians Association and the WOA Grant we have been awarded will enable us to enhance the lives of many.
Through our project we will be able to offer education in modern agricultural methods and create more opportunities for Olympians to benefit from sustainable incomes.”
 --Panama’s Sport as a tool for social change will use face-to-face classes with Olympians and elite athletes to inspire physical activity, promote sustainability and teach new skills to vulnerable children in Panama’s SOS Children’s Villages. 
The 2021 Service to Olympians Grant awardees:
 --Uganda’s Against All Odds: Uganda’s Olympic Legends will raise awareness of Olympians’ achievements with a documentary, TV miniseries and book on Uganda’s Olympians and the struggles they endured to train, participate and, for some, win medals at the Olympic Games. 
 --Colombia’s Olympic Warriors will organise an event incorporating sports, academic and cultural activities led by Colombian Olympians who will share their skills and knowledge to children, youths and adults. 
--Sri Lanka’s Livelihood enhancement of yester year needy Olympians will enhance the livelihood of Olympians and offer educational opportunities in modern agricultural methods resulting in sustainable incomes and increased capabilities.
 --Portugal’s Unleash the Olympic Potential GALA will increase the organisational structure of the Portuguese NOA, creating a detailed database of Olympians and supporting greater cohesion to deliver its social purpose of helping those in need. 
--Italy’s Passion and Victory will provide educational support and services to Olympians towards the end of their career to support them as they enter their new life and look to develop professionally.
 WOA is an IOC recognised organisation supporting the 100,000 Olympians worldwide. 
 Its remit is to work for the benefit of all Olympians at all stages of their lives, empowering them to serve society and help make the world a better place through sport. 
 With member National Olympians Associations spread across all five continents, WOA provides support to Olympian-run events and projects based on the Olympic ideals laid down by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin.

An Olympian’s Return to Competitive Sailing
 At the age of 13, Clement and his family moved to La Porte, Texas and his running hobby quickly put him on a fast track to becoming an eventual record-breaking Olympian with a made-for-a-movie storyline. 
 He won the NCAA outdoor championship in the 400-meter hurdles two years in a row, the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles in championship record time at the World Junior Championship, and he held the indoor world record in the 400-meter sprint, having broken Olympian Michael Johnson's mark, in 2005. 
 He’s a four-time World Champion and three-time Olympian having won a gold medal with the 4x400 meter team, a silver medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2008 Games in Beijing, and another gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles in Rio in 2016. 
 Saunders is not the first Olympian to speak out about her mental health: runners Brenda Martinez and Alexi Pappas, gymnast Simone Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps are among those who have discussed their struggles with depression and the role that therapy has played in their lives.

 “The reason this is happening so often is because this has been a cost-free enterprise,” said Painter, who now sits on the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
 Today, United Nations (UN) groups (for example, the Group of Governmental Experts [GGE] and the Open-Ended Working Group [OEWG]), expert commissions (for example, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace), industry coalitions (for example, the Tech Accord, the Charter of Trust), and multistakeholder collectives (for example, the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace) all purport to identify or operationalize various normative standards of behavior for states and/or other stakeholders in cyberspace. 
12 The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace and Carnegie’s Cyber Policy Initiative are more recent entrants in this category of norm processes.
The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace and Carnegie’s Cyber Policy Initiative are more recent entrants in this category of norm processes.
The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace brought together a broad and diverse set of experts on global cybersecurity.
 Following this format and the Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague in 2015, the Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders, launched the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace at the Munich Security Conference in 2017.47 The Global Commission met regularly between 2017 and 2019, drawing partly on the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports, as well as several other norm-setting processes.48 Over its lifespan, the commission proposed eight norms, including a call to “protect the public core of the internet.”49 Its final report was released on November 12, 2019, which, beyond reiterating earlier norm proposals, emphasized the need for greater focus on norm implementation.

 Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, “Final Report.” 
 Bruce McConnell, global vice president at the East West Institute, which supports the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, told FCW that one of the challenges is finding a way   to show a road map for getting these norms taken seriously.   
 The international community has been moving in this direction, building on a 2015 report by a United Nations Group of Governmental Experts that received broad UN endorsement last year, as well as multi-stakeholder support by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC). 
 Of the eight norms that have been proposed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, at least one was clearly violated: the injunction that “state and nonstate actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production.” 
 Michael Chertoff, a former U.S. secretary of homeland security, is a co-chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
 Latha Reddy, a former deputy national security adviser of India, is a co-chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
Alexander Klimburg is Director of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
 These include the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace and the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. 
 This would supplement the kind of nonstate, nonprofit work already underway [PDF] by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, protecting what they call the “public core” of the internet. 
 With the Paris Call, the Tech Accord, and the Final Report of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, there are already good examples of multistakeholder cooperation in developing cyber norms on the table. 
 “It could leave the gates open for others to come in,” said Chris Painter, former cyber diplomat for the U.S. State Department who’s now a member of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
 In my weekly column for World Politics Review, I discuss a recent report from the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace as well as some of the difficulties of establishing cyber norms. 
 Hoping to protect this vulnerable domain, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace recently issued its final report, “Advancing Cyberstability.” 
 The grid underlies the rest of the country’s critical infrastructure,” Painter, now with the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, added. 
 I will name two examples of multi-stakeholder initiatives to secure cyberspace: the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), which consisted of 28 commissioners from 16 countries, including government officials, has developed principles and norms that can be adopted by states to ensure stable and secure cyberspace. 
 In November, at the Paris Peace Forum, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace issued its report on how to provide an overarching cyber stability framework. 
 Both the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts are now considering several proposed norms that originated from the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, which we lead. 
 Bruce McConnell, global vice president at the East West Institute, which supports the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, told FCW that one of the challenges is finding a way   to show a road map for getting these norms taken seriously.   
 In the last week, France launched the   Paris Call For Trust and Security in Cyberspace   and the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace released its   Singapore Norms Package.   
 The Netherlands has also taken the lead in other norms-strengthening activities, including the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, and the Hague Process, by which that country engages in international law capacity-building around the world. 
The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace
The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace is a group of experts brought together by two European think tanks.
 Second, in May, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace proposed that “State and non-state actors should not pursue, support or allow cyber operations intended to disrupt the technical infrastructure essential to elections, referenda or plebiscites.” 
These commitments reflect much of the consensus already built on behavior in cyberspace by groups including the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security and the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
 [2] In its draft definition of cyber stability, The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace has adopted a bottom up user centric definition of Cyber Stability where individuals can be confident in the stability of cyberspace as opposed to an objective top-down determination of cybersecurity metrics. 
 At the same time, the non-governmental sector has produced a number of policy initiatives in recent years, including Microsoft’s Tech Accord, Siemens’ Charter of Trust, and the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
 Both the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts are now considering several proposed norms that originated from the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, which we lead. 
Michael Chertoff is a former US secretary of homeland security and a co-chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
Latha Reddy is a former deputy national security adviser of India and a co-chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
Alexander Klimburg is Director of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
 The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, of which I was a member, outlined a set of rules barring tampering with the Internet’s basic structure that are also in the authoritarian states’ interest if they want connectivity. 
 For instance, in 2018, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan established the Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age, which aims at “reconcil[ing] the disruptive tensions between technological advances and democracy.”29 Another body known as the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, established in 2017, is studying how norms can enhance stability in cyberspace. 
 For example, the Group of Seven (G7) members recently committed via the Dinard Declaration to sharing lessons and experiences on said norms, and it is likely they will channel those lessons and experiences into the multilateral process.51 Similarly, multi-stakeholder groups such as the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace or industry initiatives such as the Tech Accord will surely present lessons and experiences from the norms they too have been advocating. 
Two think tanks — the EastWest Institute and The Hague Center for Strategic Studies — created the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the goal of “supporting policy and norms coherence” on security in cyberspace.
Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press and the 2017 Call to Protect the Public core of the Internet of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
 We need to invest in securing the world’s supply chains from this type of attack, and to press for international norms and agreements prioritizing cybersecurity, like the 2018 Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace or the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. 
 Other efforts that present an opportunity to highlight the centrality of international law in cyberspace include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, the upcoming Global Conference on Cyberspace in India, and another series of UNIDIR workshops on international cyber security issues. 
 Deutsche Welle: Mr. Chertoff, cyberspace is a space without borders, but now, a new Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace is set to be launched and you are slated to be a commissioner. 
 As suggested by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, some rules barring tampering with the internet’s basic structure are also in authoritarians’ interests if they want connectivity. 
 In 2017, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace proposed adopting a universal standard for the protection of the public core of the Internet. 
 India has supported other non-governmental efforts such as the global conference on cyberspace (hosted in New Delhi in November 2017) and the global commission on the stability of cyberspace, both of which are developing cyber norms. 
 At a panel in the recently concluded Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) proposed eight norms including protection of the public core of internet and infrastructure essential to elections, referenda, and plebiscites. 
 Estonia has also positioned itself as a key player in normative work in cyberspace by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) and in UN deliberations, such as the UN GGE process. 
She also serves on the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
He is also a special advisor of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.
   It is going to be very interesting to see which countries will sign it and which won't   — Marina Kaljurand, chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace 
   I don't think the intention was to exclude states,   said Marina Kaljurand, chair of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a group of policy experts that contributed to the drafting of the text. 
 The choice of host for the European HQ comes as no surprise: the Netherlands, which is home to Europol, the Hague Security Delta, NATO Cyber Security Agency, and European Network for Cyber Security, has been one of the key players of the European cybersecurity world. 
 Saskia as she spoke about the Hague Security Delta (HSD), a network of about 300 partners from government agencies, research institutes, and a lot of businesses who work together on security challenges. 
 It is home to The Hague Security Delta, the world's leading security cluster, which fosters collaboration between businesses, governments and knowledge institutions. 
 9, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) signed a memorandum of understanding with a delegation of Dutch and Flemish cyber-related businesses brought to the United States by The Hague Security Delta (HSD), the largest security-related cluster of businesses, governments and academic institutions in Europe. 
 The Hague Security Delta – The HSD (2014) is the national innovation centre of the Dutch security cluster and is the largest security hub in Europe with labs, education and training facilities, flexible office space and meeting rooms to promote innovative security solutions and knowledge development. 
 Students participating in The Hague (the Netherlands) will mostly spend their time at The Hague Security Delta (HSD), the largest security cluster in Europe. 
 While a search for a physical space for housing this intended cyber security ‘magnet’ is on, three institutions have readily offered ‘space’ for the same.Once launched, the HSC will bring together security agencies of national and international importance, governments, research and knowledge institutions and cyber security businesses — much on the lines of The Hague Security Delta (HSD) that is currently the largest cyber security cluster in the world.Experts said that this move to bring all stakeholders and security agencies onto one platform will help in effective collaboration to deal with cyber crime and warfare. 
 To tackle this highly damaging form of cyber crime – and other types of attack – in the Netherlands, the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Hague Security Delta Office are working in a public-private partnership with banks, companies, governments and knowledge institutes. 
 The location is not entirely surprising, given that Deloitte is already a partner of The Hague Security Delta (HSD)* Foundation. 
 Security is integral to peace and justice, which has led to the development of the city as an important hub for cyber security in Europe and to a flourishing cluster around security and new technology called The Hague Security Delta (HSD). 
 Prior to Revnext, de Leeuw spent 15 years as Managing Director of Bee-u.nl, another strategic consulting firm, working on IT security issues with organisations such as The Hague Security Delta, the National Cyber Security Centre, DUNEA Dutch Water Industry and ING Bank. 
 But in your more recent work, like Nøtel (2015–ongoing), you base the environments on real places, like Canary Wharf and the Hague Security Delta, but you ultimately design the architecture yourself. 
 These firms include ABN AMRO, TNO, the Port of Rotterdam, The Hague Security Delta and the Dutch ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs and Climate, Justice & Security, and Infrastructure and Water. 
 Other initial members are Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University; Israel’s Cyberspark innovation centre; bwtech, a Baltimore incubator; the CyberTech Network of San Diego; Cyber Wales; La Fundación INCYDE of Madrid; Belgium’s LSEC; Italy’s Politecnico di Torino; Costa Rica’s Procomer; The Hague Security Delta in the Netherlands); and the Kosciuszko Institute in Poland. 
 The leaders welcomed the deepening of cooperation on cyber-security through the signing of an MoU between The Hague Security Delta and Hyderabad Security Cluster, India's first Cyber Security Cluster, the statement said.PM Modi and Mr Rutte called for further collaboration between the nations in the space sector and underlined the importance of space technology as an area of focus for finding solutions to deal with challenges in areas such as food security and climate change. 
 In January, members of the Hague Security Delta — a cluster of businesses and governments — offered free IT support and education for politicians and the government. 
Efforts to train politicians and government officials—carried out by The Hague Security Delta and other groups—generated little interest.
 The only two American firms on this exhaustive list were Ogilvy and Weber Shandwick, which stood first and second followed by Adfactors. 
Adfactors is India’s largest firm that is also one of the youngest among the Top 10 firms and probably the only firm among the Top 10 which is still Indian owned.
 Madan Bahal’s Adfactors began the decade as one of the leaders in the Indian public relations market, with a team of more than 250 professionals in a dozen main offices across the sub-continent and fees of around $11 million. 
 It also saw Adfactors diversify its business considerably: most notably, moving beyond the corporate arena to add expertise in digital and social media, and in areas such as corporate social responsibility and purpose. 
But the Adfactors story is not just one of exceptional growth and surprising creativity.
 In a virtual fireside chat and keynote address at YourStory’s flagship event TechSparks 2020, Madan Bahal, Managing Director, Adfactors PR, said,

 Together with its global partner ITACUS (the International Tunnelling Association‘s Committee on Underground Space), the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP) has published “Think Deep: Planning, Development and Use of Underground Space in Cities,” a book containing five case studies by planners on underground space. 
ISOCARP and ITACUS would like to continue the co-operation with a sequel to this book containing up to five real-life examples of planning for an urban underground future showcasing various cities.
The core idea is to combine the proven methodology of ISOCARP’s Young Professionals Planning Program (YPPP) with the concept of working cross-disciplinarily on underground planning issues.
 The results of the foreseen five Young Professional’s Think Deep Program (YPTDP) case studies will be collated into a follow-up publication to Think Deep and presented at the ITA WTC, ISOCARP World Congresses and the ACUUS World Congress. 
ISOCARP already organised two programs (Glasgow and Wroclaw) and is actively looking for another three cities.
ITACUS sees ISOCARP’s YPPP as an ideal example of how to actively involve ITA Young Members and make them part of a cross-disciplinary cooperation with ISOCARP Young Planners.
 ITACUS is therefore now actively setting up of a Young Professional’s Think Deep Program for young members (YPTDP), working together with ISOCARP. 
The core idea is to combine the proven methodology of ISOCARP’s YPPP with the concept of working cross-disciplinarily on underground planning issues.

A cross-team at the Europeana Foundation is made up of colleagues who work in a range of different teams across the organisation.
 The Digital Transformation Sense making workshops, the themed call for proposals for Europeana 2020 and our work with the New Professionals Task Force gave us lots of data and food for thought to work with. 
 Julia Fallon, manager of the Community and Partner Engagement team, reports the progress of this team regularly to Harry Verwayen, Europeana's Executive Director, and more formally to the Management team monthly. 
 I'm passionate about helping and supporting others, and enabling Europeana to be a platform where underrepresented voices can be heard and tell their stories is an important way for me to enact that support. 
Europeana’s strategy for 2020-2025 imagines a cultural heritage sector powered by digital and a Europe powered by culture.
 From 2020 onwards, while safeguarding the core components of the activities that have made Europeana an important agent of change over the past decade, the Europeana Strategy 2020-2025 sees Europeana focus on a single task: supporting the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage sector. 
 Both aligning with and contributing to this task, a new Europeana Copyright Strategy sets out guiding principles for Europeana’s copyright work throughout 2020 to 2025. 
 The European Commission is stepping up its support for the tourism sector to get back on track by promoting local, sustainable tourism through Europeana.

Europeana Pro will invite professionals within the Europeana Network and Aggregator Forum to share their own examples and initiatives on the Hub.
They will be encouraged to support the work further by sharing these within their own organisations and networks in order to widen the reach of the tourism initiative by Europeana.
The Commission expert group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana (DCHE) will serve as a platform to publicise the initiative and to share best practises at national level.
Europeana was launched by the European Commission on 20 November 2008;
the European Commission funds the Europeana initiative under Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).
The Communication 'tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond' (.pdf) is also supporting the European platform for Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana to develop its tourism angle highlighting European cultural jewels and hidden gems.

 Owing little to the main stem US jazz tradition, composer Michael Gibbs' orchestral suite Europeana has more in common with the work of folk-influenced English composers like Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten and Malcolm Arnold, and their particular varieties of English lyricism. 
 While some folk-based projects may indeed adopt a tone best suited to the kindergarten, Gibbs' perspective on Europeana is by contrast big, majestic, adult and mysterious. 
 Although it was regarded by most commentators as a quaint curiosity back in US-centric 1995, hindsight reveals Europeana as an important stepping stone in the evolution of contemporary European folk-jazznot as influential as the work of Jan Garbarek or John Surman perhaps, but every bit as distinctive and enduring.

 The prepend method is very similar to append() . Children are added, but this time they are prepended to the list of children of the node on which the method is called, just before the first child: 
 const parent = document . createElement ( 'div' ) const child1 = document . createElement ( 'p' ) parent . prepend ( child1 ) parent . outerHTML const child2 = document . createElement ( 'h2' ) parent . prepend ( 'just some text' , child2 ) parent . outerHTML

 Bitpanda, a “neobroker” that wants to make it easier for ordinary people to invest not just in bitcoin and other digital assets, but also gold, and any established stock that takes their interest, has picked up $170 million, a Series B that catapults the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion. 
 Bitpanda is based in Vienna, Austria and says that this equity round makes it the country’s first “unicorn” — the first startup to pass the $1 billion valuation mark. 
 “We are shifting to become a pan-investment platform, not just a crypto broker,” said Eric Demuth, the CEO of Bitpanda, who co-founded it with Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer. 
 Bitpanda’s focus up to now has been primarily on building a platform to target investors in Europe, a largely untapped market, as it happens. 
 In addition to Austria, Bitpanda is live in France, Spain, Turkey, Italy and Poland, with plans to expand to more markets this year, building hubs in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Paris and Berlin. 
 Valar is also an investor in Robinhood — which, like Bitpanda, has positioned itself as a platform to help a wider funnel of people engage and profit from trading — and most recently, earlier this month the pair co-invested in a $350 million round for BlockFi, which provides financial services like loans to crypto traders. 
 While DST is a new investor in Bitpanda, Valar also led a round for Bitpanda just six months ago — a $52 million Series A. Since then, Demuth and Klanschek say that the company has seen growth skyrocket (not unlike the price of bitcoin itself). 
Bitpanda’s growth and enthusiasm taps into a much bigger trend in the world of trading.
Bitpanda made a decision last year to start to get more aggressive in its own fundraising to ride that wave.
 Ironically, this is not that dissimilar to much of the stock market for most people, although the difference these days is that apps like Robinhood, Square Cash and Bitpanda are making it easier to engage with crypto and other trading by lowering the barrier to entry, both in terms of actually putting money into the system, and also by making it possible to get engaged with only a small amount of money. 
“We saw huge growth on Bitpanda after the COVID stock crash in March 2020.”
 While there are a number of platforms emerging for people to engage off that, the pace of adoption for Bitpanda in Europe is what attracted investors here. 
 One of the positive changes caused by the pandemic was an increased interest in personal finance, and Bitpanda’s broad offer and commitment to demystifying investing for a new breed of retail investors means it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the trend,” said James Fitzgerald, founding partner of Valar Ventures, in a statement. 
 “With over 700,000 new users in just 6 months, we know that people want access to the platform, and we’re excited to bring Bitpanda to every investor in Europe.” 
 Bitpanda founders Christian Trummer, Paul Klanschek and Eric Demuth 
 After years of resistance, mainstream investors are opening up to cryptocurrency startups as bitcoin climbs to uncharted heights.One such startup has capitalized on the boom to become Austria's very first unicorn.Neobroker Bitpanda has hit a $1.2 billion valuation following a $170 million Series B led by Valar Ventures , with support from partners of DST Global . The round is a significant step-up in funding size for the startup, which raised $52 million in September from investors including Speedinvest . It also comes off the back of an impressive growth spurt, with Bitpanda reporting the same revenue in the first two months of this year as in the whole of 2020.Cryptocurrency has surged in 2021, with bitcoin reaching a record of over $60,000 on Saturday. 
 The rally was prompted in part by a string of endorsements from institutional investors and Silicon Valley heavyweights including Twitter 's Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk.  Even in September [with Bitpanda's Series A], we noticed that traditional investors were still cautious about crypto,   said Tom Lesche, principal at Speedinvest. 
   In the case of Bitpanda, their vision is to be a neobroker across all asset classes. 
 This extension brings leading Crypto & Fintech investors Jump Capital and market makers Winterntermute Trading, to Bitpanda, with participation of LeadBlock Partners to strengthen their institutional offering and position in Europe. 
 Eric Demuth, Co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda said:   Bitcoin and digital assets have proven that they are here to stay. 
   We are very excited to partner with the Bitpanda team in their journey to build the leading pan-investment platform in Europe,   said Saurabh Sharma, General Partner at Jump Capital and continued:   Bitpanda is already the leading crypto broker in the region and as they launch some other amazing products over next few months, the platform is very well positioned to become the de facto investment platform for personal finance.   
Bitpanda's strategic incorporation to meet this surging demand comes after a $170M Series B round in March led by Valar Ventures and DST Global — raising the company's valuation to $1.2bn and giving it unicorn status.
 Bitpanda, a crypto assets platform, has closed a $52 million Series A funding round from Valar Ventures, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel. 
 Claiming 1.3 million users, Bitpanda has previously been trading digital assets and tokenizing precious metals. 
 Essentially, Bitpanda is a crypto exchange which can support other kinds of assets in a tokenized form. 
 Bitpanda is a centralized exchange with its own infrastructure, and is not running on a public blockchain. 
 As part of the investment, Valar Ventures founding partner Andrew McCormack will also join Bitpanda’s board. 
 Bitpanda, the European investment platform that just recently reached unicorn status at a valuation of $1.2B, has launched a new product called Bitpanda Stocks, which offers investing in fractional shares, with the unique possibility of 24/7 access to investing. 
Existing and new users with a verified Bitpanda account can start investing in fractional shares starting from today.
 Over the last seven years, Bitpanda has been working on enabling the public to easily invest in cryptocurrencies, precious metals and digital assets by building a successful investment platform used by millions across Europe. 
 Bitpanda is opening the door to stocks investing for anybody, giving everyone access to their investments whenever they want. 
 Plus, when it comes to being commission-free with tight spreads, Bitpanda has no service charges and no recurring fees. 
 Eric Demuth, Bitpanda CEO and co-founder commented: “This is a really exciting day for Bitpanda. 
 Investing should be simple, accessible and available to everyone - and that’s what Bitpanda Stocks is about. 
 We even added the new product to our existing Bitpanda Savings feature, allowing people to save up with their preferred asset, without stress or high app usage.” 
 All of the assets added to the platform will also be able to take advantage of the recently-launched Bitpanda Card, allowing users to make purchases with any of the assets they hold in their portfolio. 
 Users can switch the linked asset at any time via the Bitpanda iOS and Android app, allowing them to choose whether to make a purchase with a fraction of Starbucks, Amazon or Nike, Bitcoin or gold, or even traditionally with EUR. 
The launch follows the founding of the daughter company Bitpanda Financial Services and its recent approval for a MiFID II licence from the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA).
 To coincide with the launch, Bitpanda has also unveiled a new brand alongside its new website and app, including improvements to make it easier for investors to engage with their finances at a glance. 
 I’m talking about Bitpanda, a crypto exchange and card issuer headquartered in Vienna that, with this raise, is now valued at $1.2 billion. 
 What’s more, Bitpanda’s raise came just six months after a $52 million Series A, when the average time between rounds is 18 months. 
 Bitpanda has been profitable for four years, according to CEO Eric Demuth, so it doesn’t really need the funds. 
This is the second intriguing development highlighted in the Bitpanda funding round: upcoming European legislation that aims to create a unified approach to crypto industry oversight.
 What’s more, Bitpanda’s sights appear to be on more than just being the biggest crypto exchange in Europe. 
 Given the investment and regulatory interest in helping platforms like Bitpanda achieve those goals, it could be that Europe is where the merging of traditional and crypto finance takes shape first. 
 Bitpanda, an Austria-based cryptocurrency trading platform, is setting up a new tech hub in Poland in its bid to become one of the crypto industry’s biggest firms 
 According to a Wednesday tweet from Bitpanda co-CEO and co-founder Paul Klanschek, the brokerage will provide €10 million (US$12.2 million) to fund the technology and innovation center in Krakow, Poland. 
 The new team of people will be led by Bitpanda Chief Technology Officer Christian Trummer, under whom the hub aims to support a move into stocks and exchange-traded funds. 
Austrian fintech and digital trading platform Bitpanda has announced a partnership with Raiffeisen to introduce blockchain-interoperability in banking.
 Forming part of the ongoing (two and a half years) ‘Pantos’ (PAN) project , itself a joint venture between Bitpanda and the Technical University of Vienna , the company’s aim is to “enable token projects to be independent of a specific blockchain.” 
Its collaboration with Bitpanda is an attempt to address far-reaching industry challenges relating to blockchain interoperability.
 The question of how to unite all those protocols still remains unanswered,” commented Paul Klanschek, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda. 
 From now on, users of Bitpanda, the Vienna based trading platform for digital assets, can access Blockpit's legally compliant and audited proof of origin. 
Bitpanda is thus the first European trading platform to offer a fully comprehensive tax solution for trading with crypto currencies such as Bitcoin & co.
 Linz, Vienna | Blockpit and Bitpanda join forces to help more than one million traders with their tax declaration. 
 ● mySugr now allows control of the Accu-Chek Insight insulin pump directly via smartphone, starting in Austria, bringing more discretion and simplicity to the life of people with diabetes. 
 ● With the mySugr Pump Control, people with diabetes can deliver standard bolus and view pump status in the same place where they keep their diabetes data. 
 BASEL, Switzerland, May 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche today announced the launch of the mySugr Pump Control, a new module within the mySugr app. 
 The mySugr Pump Control is designed to enable people with diabetes to control an insulin pump directly via a smartphone: import its data, view its status, and remotely deliver a standard bolus. 
The mySugr Pump Control is an important building block within Roche's strategy of integrated Personalised Diabetes Management (iPDM) bringing true relief to people with diabetes by supporting their self-management of insulin pump therapy.
   When talking to people with diabetes, you realise that there is a real wish to carry as few therapy devices as possible, and that those devices should be as unobtrusive as possible,   said Adham Kassab, International Business Leader at mySugr. 
 Using the mySugr Pump Control provides people with diabetes more discretion and simplicity with their everyday insulin pump therapy.   
 The mySugr app brings together insulin pump data with other diabetes-relevant data (e.g. blood glucose data from connected meters) in one place, which helps people with diabetes to make better informed therapy decisions. 
 Users of the mySugr Pump Control are also able to get support from the mySugr Bolus Calculator, which calculates the needed amount of insulin for meal and correction boluses. 
 It considers current blood glucose level, estimated carbohydrate amount and previous insulin injections (active insulin) based on data from the mySugr Pump Control. 
   People with diabetes can either seamlessly share reports about their insulin pump therapy from the mySugr app with their doctors, or, in the near-future, pump data can also be directly transferred from the mySugr app into the RocheDiabetes Care Platform, the healthcare professional-facing key component of Roche's open ecosystem. 
We at Roche and mySugr aim to enable people with diabetes to discuss their therapy with their doctor more easily.
 The first pump to be controlled with the mySugr app is the Accu-Chek Insight insulin pump, which features pre-filled cartridges of insulin and a very low basal rate to suit individual needs. 
 The mySugr Pump Control is now available in Austria and can be used on first selected Android smartphones as part of the mySugr app, which can be downloaded from the app stores. 
 Under the brands RocheDiabetes, Accu-Chek and mySugr, comprising glucose monitoring, insulin delivery systems and digital solutions, Roche Diabetes Care unites with its partners to create patient-centred value. 
 Since 2017, mySugr, one of the most popular diabetes management apps, is part of Roche Diabetes Care.

 Postscript: mySugr points out that the the ACCC's 9 April 2021 recall notice did not mention that the incident actually occurred in October 2020, that affected versions of the iOS app were disabled, and that the bug was fixed within a few days. 
   Potentially impacted users had been informed accordingly and were asked to update the mySugr app to version 3.74.1 in order to reactivate the mySugr Bolus Calculator,   said mySugr global communications manager Sarah-Maria Richter. 
   Users can use the mySugr Bolus Calculator in the known quality.

 More than 2 million users are registered on the mySugr app, which Roche bought in 2017. 
 MySugr was recently accepted into the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) app library, adding another trust and credibility bump. 
 Serial entrepreneur Fredrik Debong who revolutionised the diabetes treatment market years back with mySugr, and hi.health co-founder Sebastian Gruber knew there had to be a better way. 
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, data from Lilly's connected insulin pen solution will become part of Roche's open ecosystem through the mySugr app in several countries outside the U.S. This integration will follow the recent launch of the Novo Nordisk smart insulin pen data integration into the mySugr app. 
   We at Roche and mySugr aim to expand the number of possibilities for people with diabetes and their caregivers to collect, share and contextualise diabetes-related data. 
 The collaboration with Lilly will enable users of the mySugr app to integrate data through Lilly's Tempo Smart Button™, which is currently pending CE mark. 
 When paired with the mySugr app, the Tempo Smart Button™ will automatically transfer data into the mySugr app enabling users to manage insulin pen data together with other diabetes-relevant data in one place. 
   We are thrilled to work with Roche and mySugr to advance our goal to better support the diabetes community. 
 Using the mySugr app's report function, people with diabetes will be given the possibility to share the documented data seamlessly with their doctors for informed discussions on insulin pen therapy.

Diabetes platform mySugr exits to Roche for as much as $100M
 mySugr, a popular digital diabetes management platform which emerged from Austria a few years ago, has been acquired by health giant Roche. 
 The mySugr app serves as diary for diabetics tracking their blood sugar, medications and activity levels and works in cooperation with insurers. 
According to some observers mySugr was valued between $75 million and $100 million.
Competitors to mySugr Livongo raised $70m and glooko has recently raised $35m.
 mySugr was founded in 2012 by Fredrik Debong, Gerald Stangl, Michael Forisch and Frank Westermann.

 “The automatic transfer of blood glucose values to the mySugr app, enables patients to easily share their results with a healthcare professional or caregiver and the transfer of data in real-time to the RocheDiabetes Care Platform allows healthcare professionals to connect to actionable insights for a more personalised approach to diabetes care.”

 First there was the investment, then there was the partnership, and now Roche is going all in and becoming the exclusive shareholder of mySugr. 
 Under the agreement, mySugr will continue to function as a separate legal entity, but will serve as the central point of Roche Diabetes Care’s patient-focused digital health services. 
 In turn, the global footprint of Roche will be a boon for mySugr’s international expansion, but its expanded role will not limit any other projects or partnerships the digital health company may wish to take on. 
 “We remain independent – the mySugr team will still be calling the shots,” the company wrote in a blog post. 
 mySugr, which was founded in 2012, is now present in 52 countries spanning 13 languages. 
 People with diabetes use the mySugr GmbH app and service for coaching, testing trips and automated data tracking thanks to integration with a wide variety of connected devices. 
 “We started mySugr to solve our everyday problems and simplify diabetes therapy through smartphones,” Frank Westermann, CEO and cofounder of mySugr said in a statement. 
 “The mySugr team has filled a gap for over a million loyal users so far, and with Roche’s diabetes expertise and global network, mySugr will become an indispensable companion for a hassle-free life.”

 Research from Refurbed, an online marketplace for refurbished electronic devices in Europe, found 73% of Irish shoppers are willing to buy a refurbished or second-hand laptop, phone or tablet to reduce their environmental impact. 
 Peter Windischhofer, co-founder of Refurbed, said the popularity of refurbished electronics has risen since the coronavirus crisis began. 
   With households across Ireland prepared to spend high amounts on electronic devices, particularly young families who are home-schooling or have a child in college, Refurbed prides itself as being the more affordable and environmentally friendly option for families in Ireland. 
Refurbed claims shoppers can also expect to save up to 40% on the original price when buying a device on its marketplace.
Think about refurbed or second-hand kit
 Buying everything new will cost a lot of money, so going the second-hand or refurbed route can save you a bundle. 
 Refurbed gaming kit has grown as a sector and there are some well-known companies like Music Magpie where you can source refurbished consoles, PC’s, monitors and controllers.

 As refurbed tech, including AirPods, may not come with the original manual, you may need to refer to the Apple support pages for guidance. 
 The problem is that refurbed products are not new, and likely had a life before they came to you. 
But it’s entirely likely with a refurbed purchase.
 Don't buy any product, refurbed or brand new, that is advertised   as-is.   
 If the device was refurbed by the original manufacturer, this may be even more likely. 
That should go for refurbed products as well.
 If you can't get at least two weeks to futz with a refurbed product with the option to return it at no cost, don't bother. 
 The Surface Pro 4 has recently had some price cuts and starts right now at $699 for the 128GB Core m3 model, so refurbed versions offer less savings.

Robo Wunderkind is an ideal learning platform to introduce kids to the world of robotics.
 Robo Wunderkind has created a learning platform to make a child’s first experience in robotics unique and memorable by providing building blocks of learning, both in the physical and metaphorical sense. 
 Robo Wunderkind took the opposite approach here by breaking its design down to simple blocks, each with its own specific function --- keeping things uncomplicated for young minds. 
 Because of its simplicity and the nature of its design, the Robo Wunderkind offers more versatility and diverse types of play activities compared to other robot kits that are already formed as an actual robot, car or character. 
 You can reinvent Robo Wunderkind into anything - from creating a robotic dog that will follow you around one day, to a tower that will fire laser shots the next, to programming it to write your name. 
 While the Robo Wunderkind robotic kit claims to target kids 5 and up, it is so simple it could also appeal to even younger groups who are already interested in building things. 
 Ranging from $199 (for the basic set) to $399 (for the top model), the pricing on the Robo Wunderkind is definitely in the high-end spectrum of stem-based robot kits. 
 Compared to other robotic kits in the same price point as our review unit (the Explorer Prime for $249 ), like the Sphero RVR for example, the Robo Wunderkind comes out ahead in terms of versatility and its accessibility to engage with younger age levels, but the Sphero is better when it came to advanced coding because it supports JavaScript and is compatible with Raspberry Pi, albeit targeting a higher age bracket. 
 Robo Wunderkind also has three levels of coding applications available - Robo Live, Robo Code, and Robo Blockly. 
The Robo Wunderkind kit comes in three variants:
The Robo Wunderkind is composed of modules and connectors.

 Similar to other STEM-based robotic kits, the Robo Wunderkind uses a built-in application that you download to your smartphone or tablet to remotely control your creation. 
 To set up your Robo Wunderkind, first choose one of the three apps available and download. 
Here are the Robo Wunderkind programming apps available:

Robo Wunderkind’s simple design and versatility make it a great fit for a younger audience who want to get into technology.
 Compared to other STEM-based robotic kits in the market, the Robo Wunderkind may not be the cheapest one you can find, but if the price tag doesn’t bother you, it will be well worth your investment. 
It’s also worth noting that expanding your Robo Wunderkind set once you have it is not that expensive.
I’ve been testing out the Robo Wunderkind Robotics Kit for the past couple of months from the perspective of an educator and a parent.
 After spending some time with it, I am ready to give you my Robo Wunderkind Robotics Kit review. 
 Like I mentioned earlier, the paradox of choice is a common problem I have with a lot of these types of kits, but the Robo Wunderkind kit takes a hard stance to avoid that. 
The Robo Live app allows you to remote control robots built with the help of Robo Wunderkind robotics kits.

 As robots increasingly replace humans in the workplace, those who possess the skills to build and program robots will have a distinct advantage, according to Vienna-based startup Robo Wunderkind. 
 As the   robotic revolution   beckons, Robo Wunderkind wants to take a proactive approach by equipping children as young as five years old with some of the skills required to become robot creators. 
   We plan to make robotics a child's play,   said Rustem Akishbekov, who founded Robo Wunderkind in 2013, roping in co-founders Anna Larotska and Yuri Levin shortly after. 
 Last year, Robo Wunderkind received an investment of $500,000 from investors such as SOSV and Arkley VC. 
 Robo Wunderkind is currently paying close attention to Australia -- its second largest market based on pre-orders -- as the nation's government increases its investment into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for children. 
 The startup recently partnered with Australian coding school Runstem, which will be using Robo Wunderkind's robots to deliver robotics classes to children later in the year. 
 Young coders will have everything they need to build their own little bots, as well as code and operate them, with the Robo Wunderkind Starter Kit. 
 Robo Wunderkind, a Vienna, Austria-based robotics and coding education startup, raised $500k in funding. 
 Led by Rustem Akishbekov, CEO, Robo Wunderkind teaches robotics and coding to children from the age of five. 
 Robo Wunderkind plans to to make the Robo Play App compatible with other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as cameras, lights, motion and light sensors. 
Robo Wunderkind aims to do for robots what littleBits and other newbie-friendly electronic kits are doing for gadgets.
 Like the aforementioned electronics kits, Robo Wunderkind greatly simplifies the act of building a robot. 
The orange rectangular box in the images is Robo Wunderkind’s core module.
 For programming the robots, Robo Wunderkind chose to go with a mobile app with a drag-and-drop interface. 
 Robo Wunderkind appears to be pretty much finalized and in fact has been tested by a couple of elementary schools, as you’ll see in the video below. 
Pledge at least $149 (USD) on Kickstarter to receive a Robo Wunderkind kit as a reward.
 Common Industry has been appointed as the UK PR agency for Robo Wunderkind to build brand awareness of its coding and robotics kits and apps for children, ahead of the busy Christmas period. 
 This was the main issue that Anna Iarotska, one of the co-founders of Robo Wunderkind, wanted to solve. 
 Robo Wunderkind developed its own simplified coding language, based on colors and symbols 
 Iarotska says the team at Robo Wunderkind developed their own simplified coding language, based on colors and symbols rather than numbers and words, so the toy can best hit its target demographic: children between the ages of 5 and 10. 
 As one of the journalists constantly being told to learn to code on Twitter, I was humbled when I resolved to turn my Robo Wunderkind kit into a makeshift car and was only able to get one of the two wheels working. 
And Robo Wunderkind is just the tip of the iceberg.
 Unlike Robo Wunderkind, Kano doesn’t teach you a fictional coding language; instead, you’re confronted with Java, Unix, and Python from the start.

 As if that wasn’t cool enough, the Robo Wunderkind kits on Kickstarter also come with LEGO adapters, so your kid can use his/her existing blocks to make additions and custom shapes. 
Robo Wunderkind creations can also be controlled via an iOS or Android app on any Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled device.
Robo Wunderkind produces robots that can be independently assembled and programmed to perform any actions.
 Designed to teach kids as young as five how to code, this starter kit from Robo Wunderkind ($179) turns every child into an inventor. 
 For the more adventurous and curious kids, there’s the Robo Wunderkind Robots.

The European Space Agency is now offering satellite-driven car parking services as a result of a partnership with a startup company called Parkbob.
Parkbob teamed up with ESA Business Applications to develop an architecture for satellite-driven availability parking services in smart cities.
 As a first step, Parkbob will access the Earth Observation satellite images from Copernicus and use them to obtain historical snapshots of on­street parking occupancy and availability in a city. 
 Parkbob and ESA say the service will be highly beneficial for the drivers, saving money, time and nerves. 
The close partnership with ESA will add a range of new opportunities and ideas for Parkbob to be discovered and tested.
 Particularly, Parkbob will have the opportunity to further elaborate their business proposition and evaluate the business viability of a satellite-based approach. 
 Based on this framework, Parkbob will be able to deploy a number of services and solutions for several use cases. 
This is part of the Parkbob DNA to be at the forefront of innovation and to use every technology available to offer the best service possible for our customers.
Parkbob founder and CEO Christian Adelsberger emphasizes how important the cooperation with ESA is for the company: “This cooperation is a major milestone for developing advanced digital last-mile solutions for mobility and a great showcase how public-private partnerships can aid implementation of new technologies in the market.
 “The project proposed by Parkbob was selected for co-funding as part of the ESA Kickstart call ‘People Mobility’, providing a convincing example of promising ideas to support smart mobility in cities.” 
 Through the ESA/Parkbob partnership, the Satellite Earth Observation data enable potential solutions for public applications, such as traffic management and city planning. 
 Moreover, Parkbob wants to demonstrate how much can be gained from the collaboration between public institutions and private companies.

That’s what Morpher CEO Martin Fröhler is looking to change.
 After founding a decentralized quantitative hedge fund in Silicon Valley, Martin co-developed the Morpher Protocol to replicate the trading of any market, on the blockchain, without actually trading underlying assets. 
 In the simplest way, Morpher cuts out the middleman -- brokers, exchanges, and counterparties -- allowing market participants the ability to trade assets, with infinite liquidity, on an incorruptible protocol. 
 “Morpher provides global access to anyone who trades on limited markets, with infinite liquidity.” 
That’s the gap Fröhler is looking to bridge with Morpher.
 With Morpher, every market can be shorted or bought at any time with any amount of leverage. 
 How It Works: Morpher observes exchange-traded markets, via real-time data feeds from providers like IEX, a stock exchange, and data infrastructure platform. 
 If a market participant is interested in betting on a stock, Morpher takes the price of the stock, creates virtual shares of it, and whenever the bet is closed, the participant receives a token payout. 
 For example, if one was to bet 100 Morpher tokens on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and the stock rallies 10%, the user would end up with 110 Morpher tokens. 
 “You receive 100 Morpher tokens, initially. 
Morpher has stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.
 “Hypothetically, we can turn anything with a reliable, real-time data feed into a market that’s tradable on Morpher.” 
 On the product side, is a decentralized DeFi app for the Morpher Protocol that does not run on our side chain, but directly on ETH -- a Uniswap for all kinds of assets.” 
Jeffrey Woolf with the foldable Morpher helmet he first made in 2013.
 Jeffrey Woolf, 61, a serial inventor, created Morpher, a bicycle helmet that folds flat and slips easily into a bag, after he was involved in a hit-and-run crash in Hampstead, north London. 
 On August 31, 2020, Morpher Labs announced the launch of its flagship Ethereum-based contract trading and prediction market platform, Morpher, with the stated goal of providing users unlimited access to long-and-short trades of real-world stocks, commodities, and FOREX markets. 
 In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Morpher Labs CEO Martin Froehler explained that Morpher’s vision is to allow worldwide access to asset classes that normally have multiple barriers in the form of geographical restrictions, middlemen, and steep fees. 
 Morpher, meanwhile, is attempting to tackle the liquidity problem with a token-economic solution. 
 “The [Morpher] smart contract creates or destroys MPH token depending on the outcome of [a] bet,” explains Froehler. 
 Thus far, the results of Morpher’s model have been mixed. 
 According to Forehler, in the nearly two months since launch Morpher has attracted 28 thousand users. 
 The Morpher Twitter account, however, has reported numerous withdrawal outages. 
 While it remains to be seen if Morpher will be able to solve the problems faced by prediction markets, Froehler remains a zealot for the end mission: to provide global access to real world assets without middlemen: 
 “We are convinced that the full potential of the Morpher Protocol will only unfold once it is universally accessible, and we are working hard on making that happen.” 
 Along with his co-cre­ator, Thomas Wiesner, the chief tech­nol­ogy offi­cer at Morpher, a trad­ing plat­form for cryp­tocur­ren­cies and cryp­to­graphic assets, Sterlicchi is prepar­ing to trans­form 10 uniquely pack­aged bot­tles of extra vir­gin olive oil into NFTs. 
 If you own a Morpher folding helmet or an older version of the small Woom children's helmet, replace it as soon as possible 
 That company, Morpher, is now closed. 
 The two new recalls are for the Morpher folding helmet, which was sold in one size, and the Woom Bikes' children's helmet in size Small only. 
 According to the CPSC, which announced the recall Thursday, the Morpher   failed to meet federal safety standards.   
 Morpher sold about 8,500 of the models through its own website and Amazon.com. 
 Since Morpher is no longer in business and unable to conduct a recall, the CPSC is telling consumers to stop using the helmets and dispose of them. 
It said Amazon and Morpher are contacting all known purchasers.
 In Consumer Reports' testing, results of which were published in July 2019, the Morpher failed impact tests, specifically to the rear of the helmet. 
 Morpher founder Jeff Woolf told BRAIN at the time that CR's article would   wreck   his company. 
 Morpher launched following a 2013 Indiegogo campaign that raised $400,000. 
 Now the Morpher website consists of a notice saying,   Unfortunately, due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, I regret to inform you that we have been forced to cease operations. 
   It’s being great fun developing the folding helmet market and if you are a Morpher owner then thank you so much for your support.

The Blood Morpher in Outriders is yet another strong enemy that players are pitted against within the Forest Enclave.
 Luckily, the Blood Morpher isn't nearly as serious when compared to a boss like the Chrysaloid. 
 When making progress towards the Blood Morpher, players will encounter an arena-like space, and a fight will begin. 
 When all the enemies are killed, it's time to head forward and prepare for the Blood Morpher fight. 
How can players defeat the Blood Morpher in Outriders?
 However, once they are taken out, it's time to start fighting the Blood Morpher. 
The Blood Morpher is a humanoid monster that appears to have a tad of Perforo mixed into it.
A large health pool and a diverse set of attacks define how the Blood Morpher fights in Outriders.
 For attacks, the Blood Morpher has a dash ability that can do some serious damage if Outriders players are caught with it. 
Outriders players should use the environment and the more narrow pathways to close distance on the Blood Morpher.
 Freezes or traps can slow down the Blood Morpher, but if players don't have those, they should stay mobile and fire when open. 
 Casentini went on to say in that same interview that, “I think we found a really great balance (between serialized and episodic) with Power Rangers Beast Morphers.” 
In the process though he experimented on the RPM morpher that had Venjix in it and accidentally released him into the Grid Battleforce computer system.
If Beast Morphers were going to explore that I’d applaud them for it but the episode doesn’t do that.
Beast Morphers should have been incorporating its lessons like this all the time.
 Many fans have speculated Evox is actually Venjix, who famously hid himself inside one of the RPM morphers at the end of Power Rangers RPM. 
With Dr. K’s appearance earlier this season and a very clear shot of those morphers a few episodes back?
 There hasn’t been a new episode of Power Rangers Beast Morphers, the current series, aired in America since April of 2020!

 Thus, massive MIMO is a cornerstone of 5G network to provide a good user experience. 
All major infrastructure vendors invest heavily in the development of massive MIMO products.
The major vendors announced new massive MIMO products recently.
 But compared to the hardware upgrade, the innovation on massive MIMO algorithms could be more attractive to operators. 
Massive MIMO systems require a combination of antenna expansion and complex algorithms.
Algorithms are actually at the heart of massive MIMO system design and optimization.
 Various algorithms will be required to implement massive MIMO functions, such as: 
Channel estimation: the beamforming and adaptive modulation and coding of massive MIMO system rely on the knowledge of channel parameters.
 At the recent Huawei Global Analyst Summit, Huawei mention the Adaptive High Resolution (AHR) algorithms to improve massive MIMO performance in all three areas above.

 CEBU CITY, Philippines — Rachel “Cutie” del Mar, the daughter of the late Cebu City North District Representative Raul del Mar, and Mariano “Mimo” Osmeña, the son of Former Cebu Governor Emilio “Lito” Osmeña may be running head to head for the congressional seat of Cebu City’s North District in next year’s elections. 
 Lito has always kept a close relationship with the Del Mar family and although reports have circulated that Cutie will be running for a congressional seat, he said he does not want Mimo and Cutie to fight over the position. 
 I want them both (Mimo) to serve the country and Cebuanos,” said the former governor. 
 As for businessman, Mimo Osmeña, he is yet to decide if he will be running for the congressional seat, but he said he is now ready to run for an elective position in the government. 
 But I have not decided yet,” said Mimo. 
 Mimo said that whether he runs for an elective position or not, he will continue to serve the Cebuano public through his radio programs. 
I currently get 50Mbps D/L and 10 U/L with the Iskra P-58 L700 U-MIMO LTE Antenna and a 10m SMA cable into a Archer MR200 Gen2
 Mimo's House of Wings in Verona closed May 29, according to a post on its Facebook page. 
 Fifteen years ago, Good's friend asked her to help run his new pub restaurant Mimo's, located at 283 Lee Highway in Verona. 
Complex smart antenna systems such as MMIMO expected to be used extensively.
It also contains the author's survey of recently approved patents related to VLC and MIMO technologies.
That’s why antenna systems are increasingly upgrading from single-input/single-output (SISO) architectures to multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO).
 But the smaller the device, the more challenging MIMO becomes from a design perspective, such as providing ample isolation between each antenna element. 
 For applications with long cable runs, such as 10 m, low-loss cables are critical for ensuring that a MIMO antenna can establish and maintain a reliable connection. 
 “This unique antenna delivers powerful MIMO antenna technology, and we knew we could rely on their team to reduce the risks and time associated with integrating it into our technology.” 
 Two days after Ericsson announced that it had a 64T64R Massive MIMO antenna radio unit that weighs just 20kg, Huawei announced at MWC Shanghai that its latest equivalent tips the scales at only… 19kg. 
That seems to be another reference Ericsson’s M-MIMO launch this week.
Huawei also announced growing support for FDD Massive MIMO – something it says is rising up operator checklists as more devices support the option.
 “Today we are bringing an FDD M-MIMO product, the first in the industry that is ready for large scale commercial rollout based on M-MIMO,” Chaobin said. 
 Finally, Huawei announced “the first Massive MIMO distributed indoor solution”, announcing trials in South Korea with LGU+ of a Lampsite deployment that included MU-MIMO indoors. 
 Airtel has also deployed advanced network technologies and tools such as pre-5G Massive MIMO, 4G advanced and carrier aggregation to step up high-speed network capacity and coverage, he added. 
 Airtel has also deployed advanced network technologies and tools such as pre-5G Massive MIMO, 4G advanced and carrier aggregation to step up high-speed network capacity and coverage, he added. 
Samsung is touting new technology for its Massive MIMO radios that the vendor says is expected to enhance network throughput by up to 30% for 4G and 5G environments.
 Dubbed Mobility Enhancer, the newly developed tech uses advanced signal processing and AI to improve beamforming accuracy from Samsung’s Massive MIMO unit toward users on the go - for example, a 5G consumer walking down the street. 
Samsung expects to add the new tech to its Massive MIMO radios via software upgrade that will be available globally this year.
Austrian edtech startup GoStudent expands its digital one-to-one tutoring service beyond Europe for the first time.
 After securing a Series B investment of €70 million at the end of March, GoStudent launched its platform in Russia in May, to be followed by Mexico and Canada this summer. 
 Founded in 2016, GoStudent’s digital learning platform brings students of all ages together with carefully selected teachers in a virtual one-on-one classroom setting. 
 GoStudent is one of the highest funded and fastest growing B2C education startups in Europe, with 11 office locations, a presence in 18 countries, 500+ employees and 5000+ tutors. 
 GoStudent’s digital learning platform connects students of all ages in individually designed, virtual lessons with carefully selected teachers. 
 In the last 10 months, GoStudent set foot in European markets such as Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, France and Greece and has strengthened its position as a leading online tutoring provider. 
 At the beginning of May, GoStudent officially launched in Russia, Moscow and is preparing to expand its services to Mexico and Canada this summer. 
 Additionally, GoStudent will also enter the Polish market in anticipation of it’s further expansion in Eastern Europe. 
 Felix Ohswald, Co-Founder and CEO of GoStudent on the advancing internationalization of his company: “In less than a year, through the excellent work and passion of our ever-growing team, we were able to scale GoStudent from a tutoring provider in the German-speaking market to a European level and secure the market leadership for digital tutoring in Europe. 
 Gregor Müller, Co-Founder and COO of GoStudent added: “We connect every student with the ideal tutor. 
 With the launch of new markets outside of Europe for the first time, GoStudent reaches a fundamental milestone on its way to becoming a global player in the digital tutoring sector. 
 Laura Warnier, GoStudent’s Chief Growth Officer responsible for internationalization, on the expansion strategy: “Our goal is to be the first digital tutoring provider in countries with high market potential and thus benefit from first-mover advantages, such as building strong brand awareness and customer loyalty before other market players jump on the bandwagon.” 
 GoStudent describes its market entries in Russia, Mexico and Canada as “test markets”. 
GoStudent’s team has grown from 160 to over 500 employees since the beginning of the year.
 Vienna-based e-learning startup GoStudent has increased the Series A round it raised earlier this year to €13.3 million, adding €5 million this week in a round led by Left Lane Capital and DN Capital. 
GoStudent operates a platform connecting students with teachers worldwide for individual and group tutoring sessions.
 CEO and co-founder Felix Ohswald said: “During the current crisis, GoStudent became an eye-opener for parents across Europe and showed that online tutoring is the key to making high-quality education widely accessible. 
 Vinny Pujji, partner at Left Lane Capital, said: “GoStudent’s high quality, yet affordable, solution is bringing many students into the world of online education for the first time. 
 Nenad Marovac, managing partner and CEO at DN Capital said: “GoStudent is expanding across Europe at lightning speed while maintaining a strong focus on superior learning outcomes.” 
 In Europe GoStudent competes with independent freelancers offering their services online and offline on marketplaces like Superprof and MyTutor, as well as institutions like Acadomia in France, Schülerhilfe in Germany and Titanium Tutors in the U.K. 
 Vienna-based GoStudent, which connects students to tutors on a virtual learning platform, has raised a €70 million Series B funding round led by new U.S. investor Coatue. 
 GoStudent competes with offline players like Schülerhilfe in Germany and Acadomia in France, which focus on small-classes in learning centers. 
 By doing it online, GoStudent can introduce cost savings for users. 
 GoStudent is aiming for 15 countries across Europe and to grow its team to 800+ employees and 10,000+ tutors. 
 Felix Ohswald, co-founder and CEO of GoStudent, said in a statement: “The series B investment makes us the best-funded consumer K12 education start-up in Europe! 
Our growth targets this year are enormous – the investment of 70 million euros will enable us to position GoStudent as the top player in Europe for making high-quality education widely accessible.”
 Harley Miller, managing partner at Left Lane Capital said: “It’s been an exciting journey as an investor to see GoStudent expand so elegantly across Europe, offering affordable yet high-quality education to the masses.” 
 Nenad Marovac, managing partner and CEO at DN Capital, said: “We believe that GoStudent can be the dominant winner in online tutoring in Europe, by leveraging technology GoStudent democratizes quality education to all.” 
 Vienna, Austria-based GoStudent, an edtech startup has raised €70M in its Series B round of funding from new investor Coatue together. 
The investment follows GoStudent’s €8.3M Series A round which happened just four months ago.
The Austrian ed-tech startup GoStudent is further expanding its online tutoring service across Europe.
 On January 21, GoStudent will not only celebrate its fifth anniversary, but will also expand its online tutoring service, which started in the DACH region, to five additional European markets. 
 After launching Belgium, France and Spain last year, GoStudent will expand to England, Ireland, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands in the first quarter of 2021. 
 Also, GoStudent will open its third international office in Madrid soon. 
 Founded in 2016, GoStudent’s digital learning platform brings students of all ages together with carefully selected teachers in a virtual one-on-one classroom setting. 
 In 2020, GoStudent quadrupled their team to 160 employees. 
Investor confidence was also high – GoStudent received €13.3 million in investment last year.
 The opening of GoStudent’s third international office in Madrid (after Vienna and Lyon) and the expansion of the service to five more countries, is just the beginning, they say. 
 Laura Warnier, Chief Growth Officer at GoStudent and responsible for internationalisation, gave an outlook on the growth targets for this year: “By the end of 2021, we want to expand our online tutoring services to fifteen countries. 
 In the first quarter of 2021, the GoStudent team will also grow by 100 additional positions. 
 GoStudent.nl €5,500 – This domain forwards to Bijlesnetwerk.nl, a Dutch tutoring network. 
Vienna-based digital learning platform GoStudent has closed an €8.3 million Series A round led by Left Lane Capital.
 Harley Miller, managing partner at Left Lane, commented: “Unlike in Asia, and to a lesser extent in the US, tutoring in Europe has historically been stigmatized, but GoStudent is changing the paradigm and positioning tutoring as a proactive muscle that all students can and should exercise.” 
 Founded in 2017, GoStudent operates throughout the DACH region but will expand to other European markets with the help of the new financing.

A spokeswoman for GoStudent said: ‘In allowing Anthony Canavan to become a GoStudent online maths tutor we have fallen well below our own standards and safeguarding rules.
When this was brought to our attention we immediately terminated Mr. Canavan’s freelance shifts and he is no longer able to work as a GoStudent online tutor.

It's made by Winning Streak Games and published by THQ Nordic.
 Nonetheless, we took this as a chance to reach out to publisher THQ Nordic to enquire about the work that went into Biomutant's Hindi subtitles and the possibility of voiceovers in future releases. 
 THQ Nordic's head of PR, Florian Emmerich, tells IGN India that the decision to include Hindi subtitles in Biomutant comes from a desire to attract more players to the game. 
Will Future THQ Nordic Games Have More Indian Localisation?
 Unfortunately, Emmerich couldn't commit to the possibility of Hindi voice acting for future THQ Nordic releases. 
 THQ Nordic has stated in the past, however, that Biomutant will be coming to new consoles some time in the future. 
 Taking to Twitter earlier today, publisher THQ Nordic reminded everyone that developer Experiment 101 is technically not triple-a and despite consisting less than two dozen staffers has still worked hard on Biomutant for several years. 
THQ Nordic understands why many PS5 owners out there will not be happy about the game’s supported resolution but requests them to not question the “skill or dedication” of Experiment 101.

 As part of the launch, THQ Nordic has also revealed something bigger: That cute little Biomutant won’t be alone.

 Embracer Group, the Swedish games holding company and publisher formerly known as THQ Nordic AB, already contains multitudes after a spree of acquisitions in recent years. 
 For context, its current operating groups include Koch Media, THQ Nordic, Saber Interactive, and recent acquisition Gearbox Entertainment Furthermore, Embracer says it is in over 20   late-stage talks   with companies for potential acquisition, though it again does not provide information on what kinds of companies these might be. 
 Aside from the larger operating groups, THQ Nordic also owns several smaller operations, such as QA company Quantic Lab, PR company Sandbox Strategies, and the recent acquisition of Swedish studio Frame Break.Embracer has had acquisition fever in recent years, picking up over 30 different companies in the last two and a half years. 
THQ Nordic has updated the 1.4 patch notes and posted the following:
 Even if a Kingdom Come sequel doesn't rear its head at E3 this year, as of last year publishers Deep Silver and THQ Nordic have 69 unannounced titles in the works, so we can absolutely expect some form of surprise to be revealed this week. 
WE ARE FOOTBALL is a new take on football management games from Winning Streak Games and THQ Nordic.
 The announcement was made as part of Koch Media's reveal of Prime Matter, a brand-new publishing wing joining Deep Silver and THQ Nordic under the Koch umbrella. 
 On November 17, Embracer Group (a game publisher formed from the combination of THQ Nordic and Nordic Games Publishing) announced the acquisition of a dozen game studios. 
 One of Embracer Group’s big divisions is THQ Nordic, based in Vienna, Austria. 
 I spoke with THQ Nordic CEO Klemens Kreuzer, who described the thinking behind the company’s frenetic expansion pace. 
 One pillar is THQ Nordic, and the others are Koch Media, Deep Silver, Saber, Coffee Stain, and DECA Games. 
 We at THQ Nordic, we saw that you must provide a setup where people and teams can make perfect results and perfect games. 
 We have 16 studios within THQ Nordic, and each studio is different in how they get things done. 
All 16 studios we have in THQ Nordic are searching for people.
But the marketing and PR team at THQ Nordic is 12 people.
 It was roughly 55 million euros on the THQ Nordic side, out of more than 200 million. 
The personnel fluctuation at THQ Nordic is very low.
GamesBeat: It feels like this makes Embracer and THQ Nordic unique companies in the game industry.
 As THQ Nordic, for example, we’ll never go into the free-to-play market. 
 We try to keep the studios informed of what we’re doing as THQ Nordic, how we deal with problems like the pandemic.

 THQ Nordic acquires Kaiko, Appeal, and Massive Miniteam Publisher's latest acquisitions include its frequent partner for modern remasters, the developer of Outcast, and the studio behind Spitlings 
Companies in this article THQ Nordic
THQ Nordic today announced the acquisition of three more developers to its sprawling corporate org chart.
 Based in Frankfurt, Kaiko has partnered with THQ Nordic on a host of its remastered re-releases, including Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning, Red Faction Guerilla ReMars-tered, and Darksiders Warmastered Edition. 
 Massive Miniteam is another company THQ Nordic has prior experience with, as the German studio worked with THQ Nordic-subsidiary HandyGames to publish its multiplatform platformer Spitlings last year. 
 Technically HandyGames is the acquiring outfit in this deal, and THQ Nordic said it is working with Massive Miniteam on several projects currently. 
THQ Nordic said the studio is currently working on an open-world action adventure.
Terms of these acquisitions were not disclosed but THQ Nordic said it would reveal more in its earnings call later this month.
 Finally, THQ Nordic also established two new subsidiaries, a French distribution outfit called THQ Nordic France SAS and Sarajevo, Bosnia, and Herzegovina-based animation tech company Gate 21 d.o.o. 
 You may remember earlier this year, Gearbox was acquired by Embracer Group, the same company that owns other publishers like THQ Nordic and Deep Silver. 
 However, four years later, on January 26th, THQ Nordic and Experiment 101 gave us a release date, and as we closed in on May 25th, I did my best to consume as much information about the game as possible. 
 In my time on Twitter, THQ Nordic responded to me one time, telling me that the choices weren’t always black and white. 
 Remarkably, THQ Nordic (parent company of Koch Media) in 2019 It was already announced that a new Saints Row was being worked on and that we should hear more about it in 2020, but now that a year has passed, I’m not yet ready to share anything about this game. 
The SpongeBob SquarePants effect: Why THQ Nordic is doubling down on licenses CEO Klemens Kreuzer discusses the Purple Lamp acquisition and being part of the ever-expanding Embracer empire
Companies in this article THQ Nordic
 The team of 38 is now 100% owned by the game's publisher, THQ Nordic. 
 Given that Purple Lamp only began working with THQ Nordic in January 2018, it's clear the studio made quite the impression on its new owner, not only bringing the beloved SpongeBob game back to market but also assisting with the Early Access development of The Guild 3. 
 For THQ Nordic CEO Klemens Kreuzer, Purple Lamp's performance with the SpongeBob project made it an essential purchase. 
 Kreuzer adds the deal was a   no brainer   because the opportunity arose at a time when THQ Nordic had decided to ramp up its efforts in developing and releasing licensed games, for which it needed a team with certain expertise. 
 But THQ Nordic's current output harks back more to the early 2000s, and Kreuzer believes the reception to SpongeBob's remake proves there is demand for such titles. 
 But at THQ Nordic, we're not going for the super AAA stuff where we need millions and millions to be successful. 
 But, he emphasises, THQ Nordic did not purchase Purple Lamp solely to develop remakes and remasters. 
 While THQ Nordic is now focusing more on licensed titles, it's certainly not neglecting original IP. 
 The game is one of 61 projects currently in development at THQ Nordic, of which only 21 have been announced so far. 
 Of the latest cohort of studios to be brought into the Embracer Group, Purple Lamp is the only one that falls under the ownership and responsibility of THQ Nordic. 
   I wouldn't exclude [the possibility] that maybe one day we'll make a deal where a publishing entity out there would be a good fit for our THQ Nordic family   
   At THQ Nordic, we've done 42 acquisitions since 2011 -- a mix of assets, companies and deals where we just bought the IP. 
 THQ Nordic is, of course, on the lookout for other potential acquisitions --   we have a few in mind that we'll start talking to,   says Kreuzer -- although there's no specific type of company the publisher is hunting for at the moment. 
Most of its teams are dedicated to development -- 16 of the 20 business that come under THQ Nordic -- but the CEO is open to branching out.
   I wouldn't exclude [the possibility] that maybe one day we'll make a deal where a publishing entity out there would be a good fit for our THQ Nordic family,   he says. 
 The pack includes a competition car based on the Formula 1 chassis (it has a Dominus hitbox) and 10 decals spanning Alfa Romeo to Williams, so you can support your favorite team, or pick the one that looks newest and coolest. 
 Unlike a game like Fortnite where all the character models feature the same hitbox, the hitbox of your Sea of Thieves scoundrel will be determined by the actual character design. 
 With her life-saving tactical ability, small hitbox, and game-changing ultimate, Wraith is capable of turning the odds of even the most one-sided fights in her favor. 
 The new F1-themed item pack includes the Formula 1 2021 car (using the Dominus hitbox), individual decals for Alfa Romeo, AlphaTauri, Alpine, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Haas, McLaren, Mercedes-AMG Petronas, Red Bull and Williams, and last but not least, a set of Pirelli tires. 
When you ask a game developer about hitboxes you'll get a range of reactions.
 One developer responded to my call for insight with   Ugh, hitboxes.   
 Hitboxes are the invisible geometry that tells a game when and how things collide, which doesn't sound like an emotional topic. 
 But while hitboxes are essential to most games, they're also weird and difficult. 
 Hitboxes are an attempt to make a game behave the way players think it should, and that makes them a massive design challenge which involves cheating the details, taking shortcuts, and obsessing over tiny changes. 
 In short, a good hitbox is hard to make, a problem game developers have to solve over and over again. 
 Hitboxes are so elemental to games that whether you're conscious of them or not, you're always playing around them 
 You need a hitbox for a thrown fist or spinning blade—the thing doing the hitting—and another for the thing getting hit, often called a   hurtbox.   
 But whatever the type of hitbox, the rules for how they work aren't set in stone. 
 For example, your character's hitbox in Dark Souls pretty much exactly matches your visible model as you move around, precisely enough that you can avoid getting hit by some attacks by simply changing your stance. 
 The same goes for the Monster Hunter series, in which the hitbox has followed the player and the monster models faithfully since Monster Hunter Tri in 2009. 
 Hitboxes are so elemental to games that whether you're conscious of them or not, you're always playing around them, feeling out their shapes and the flexibility they offer. 
 For third person 3D action games like these, having your hitbox match your body makes sense. 
 Their hitboxes are usually much smaller than the player character (or ship), to help you dodge through screens full of bullets. 
Making the hitbox the full size of the ship would be more difficult and more frustrating.
Indie shmup Blue Revolver actually has an option to highlight the ship's hitbox.
 In Endlight your ship has three hitboxes, depending on situation. 
Not all hitboxes are for fighting.
 (Actually, the whoosh hitbox has two sizes. 
 The point is, hitboxes are complicated.) 
 Disc Room uses hitboxes to create effects that emphasise the action of its instant-death, high-velocity sawblades. 
Those discs are a good example of how varied hitboxes can be: the area where the sawblades are actually lethal is well within their teeth.
And a faster disc actually has a smaller hitbox.
 The gray circle on the right shows the blade's actual hitbox (Image credit: Terri, Dose, Kitty, and JW) 
Disc Room's hitboxes don't only exist in space—they also exist in time.
   You're actually allowed to be inside a hitbox for up to 50 milliseconds, roughly three frames, before you die. 
That's what hitboxes are really trying to do: Make the outcome of the game match up with what you expect.
 What that means varies from game-to-game, so hitbox design and implementation is far from universal. 
 When time is slowed, should the player hitbox become even smaller? 
 Developer Metanet spent a full 10 years tweaking and polishing the hitboxes for their classic ninja platformer N, right into the closing weeks of N++ .   The gold collision shape became a little bit bigger, the mines a little bit smaller, so it's less frustrating, less clunky to get around,   Mare Sheppard says. 
   The hitbox on his jab just wasn't exaggerated enough to allow him to land the first blow to start a combo. 
 So yeah, it's unrealistic for a jab to have a big hitbox, but because he has nothing far out, it's worth exaggerating it so it's rewarding when they dodge and evade everything coming their way to get in and get the combo.   
 Despite the name, hitboxes aren't always   boxes.   
 While Dark Souls, Monster Hunter World, and Apex Legends hitboxes follow the form of the characters, more or less, in other genres, from platformers to fighting games, they take many shapes: Spheres, lozenges and capsules. 
 Fighting games still generally use the square hitboxes established by Street Fighter 2, with some outliers like Marvel vs. Capcom, which uses circles. 
 While hitbox design is pretty well understood, their technicalities are still a difficult science. 
 Think about Doom Eternal as a simple example: Every frame, it has to check the player hitbox against the ground and every wall in the level, and every demon and object. 
 Then it also has multiple hitboxes for each demon so they respond to projectiles differently, and each bullet and projectile has to be seen to hit walls, floors and objects. 
 Since the game is on-rails, McGinley knows that each object will arrive at the player 20 seconds after spawning, so they're only given a hitbox when they're 18 seconds old (for an idea of how important this tiny detail, he calls this   Endlight's greatest trick  ). 
 When hitboxes are done badly, games seem unfair; they break with our expectations. 
   When hitboxes are done well, you won't even have to think about them,   says Nijman. 
Apex Legends Hitboxes are Such a Nightmare; Respawn Explains Why
Hitboxes in general are contentious in all forms of competitive games.
 The hitbox determines if you can hit an opponent or not, after all. 
 Apex Legends has it rough when it comes to hitboxes; the various characters have different shaped hitboxes, which makes sense, but is also very aggravating. 
Senior Game Designer Daniel Klein feels the varying size hitboxes are a “curse” in Apex Legends.
 “If I had a time machine, I’d go back to when we started working on Apex and yell at everyone: DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT HITBOX SIZES! 
 When you account for the size of the Apex Legends hitboxes, it becomes difficult to judge how much damage should account for that. 
“Let’s put it this way: Caustic with Wraith’s hitboxes would have a higher win rate than Wraith with Caustic’s hitboxes.
This means we had to find something that directly acted on the level of success/failure that hitboxes work on; and a damage multiplier was the best solution.”
 Granted, Season 7 updated Pathfinder’s hitbox, so he has a more shootable frame. 
 It doesn’t seem like they’re going to change everyone’s hitbox though, so these problems are going to persist well into the future of Apex Legends. 
 There are no real good options to fix this, other than perhaps re-modeling every single Legend, and keep their hitboxes the same somehow. 
 Hitboxes are a weird mix of science and psychology, and they’re very difficult to design, as I laid out in my feature about how they work . What feels just right for one player might look ridiculous to another. 
 If you search for ‘hitbox’ and you’ll find a thousand videos titled   WORST HITBOX   and   This game’s hitboxes are broken!   
But what is a bad hitbox?
 While learning about hitboxes, I talked to expert players about some examples of problematic hitboxes to dig into what can make them go wrong. 
 These aren't necessarily the worst hitboxes around, but they can help us understand how hitbox issues can have on the game around them. 
 When a hitbox just seems off, here's what might be happening. 
But that was what happened after Street Fighter 5 changed one of Ryu’s hitboxes.
 But in SF5 the length of its hitbox was reduced, killing the technique of shuffling forward in crouch, popping out explorative crouching shorts until an opening presents itself. 
The problem: Even a small hitbox change can drastically affect competitive game balance
There’s a hitbox bug in Dark Souls which will almost never affect you.
The bug causes an active hitbox to invisibly persist in the world if it exists at the moment a cutscene starts.
 It hits catalystz, knocking him over, as the cutscene for Ornstein’s death starts, thus fixing the Trample Charge hitbox in space. 
 The problem: If a bug locks a hitbox in place, it can become an invisible killing field. 
 For catalystz, Stray Demon’s butt-slam is one of the worst hitboxes in Dark Souls. 
 (catalystz’s most hated hitbox is Titanite’s jump attack:   It does nothing with clarity. 
Everything has a hitbox when he lands; they extend and shrink.
The problem: Some hitboxes extend past a character model but don't convey the attack with graphical effects.
 Most modern shooters map hitboxes to what you see, which is why Apex Legends lets you shoot through tiny holes in its scenery. 
 But Pathfinder’s hitbox has had a rocky path to accuracy over the game’s short history, pinballing between making him the easiest character to hit to one of the hardest. 
   When Apex first started, Pathfinder had a massive hitbox; basically you could shoot his aura and you’d hit him,   says Nocturnal, a member of Team Liquid’s Apex Legends team. 
 Respawn revised Pathfinder’s hitbox, so that in spring 2019 it pretty much exactly followed his core body and limbs. 
 But with thin metal legs and the bulky protruding equipment on Pathfinder’s back which wasn’t part of the hitbox, Pathfinder became notoriously hard to hit. 
 But now it’s fixed, and if the servers are at their best, the hitboxes are pretty much on-point.   
 The problem: Adhering exactly to a character's body sounds like the best, most accurate hitbox, but it's not always that simple. 
 Monster Hunter World is extremely scrupulous in making sure what you see is what actually happens, and its hitboxes follow its models very closely. 
But that doesn't necessarily make a hitbox feel good.
 At first I thought it was an unfair hitbox, because it felt like you’re getting hit by a vacuum. 
 So what was previously a powerful attack but not a large hitbox is now much larger.   
 The problem: Just because a hitbox is accurate, it doesn't guarantee being hit by an attack will actually feel fair, depending on the attached animation and player expectations. 
 Players can be pretty scathing about what they perceive as bad hitboxes, especially in competitive games. 
 In a February 2020 update, the anchor model was modelled to better match its hitbox, just as a series of Riot developers showed off their takes on Dredge Line’s power. 
 Hitboxes work through maths and science, but what really matters about them is that they communicate clearly with players. 
Problem: Even games as big as League of Legends still struggle to perfectly convey the hitbox of special abilities.
 For more on how hitboxes are made and what makes them so tricky to get right, read our feature here. 
Hitboxes can be shown in both the java and bedrock editions of Minecraft.
Hitboxes in Minecraft outline living things or mobs in the game.
The hitbox also applies to players and their friends.
The hitbox will include a red line that wraps around the middle of the head of a mob where its eyes are.
The red line in a hitbox indicates the line of sight for the mob.
Green boxes on the hitbox of the ender dragon are an indicator of where a player can damage it.
Hitboxes can be used by players as guidelines for hitting a mob in the game.
 If the hitbox doesn't cover the entire mob, the parts that aren't on the hitbox will not affect the mob if hit. 
An example of a mob that has parts outside of the hitbox is ghast.
 Looking ahead at the California grape season, early projections anticipate a crop size similar to 2020. 
“The crops of California grapes look good.
 But the temperature drops this week,” says Chris Unti of Sun Grapes Marketing Inc. 
He adds that there haven’t been any significant fires in the state yet--in 2020 smoke from the California wildfires did affect the quality of some table grape crops.
 This year, the Mexican grape season began two weeks late. 
Variety development also continues in the California grape season.
 He notes that end of season varieties of California grapes that would ship in November in December, are shrinking in volume as South America begins producing grapes earlier. 
Unti notes that overall there is a reduction in the volumes of grapes the state produces.
 “People were staying home more and grapes are something people eat at home more than in a restaurant or travelling,” says Unti. 
 Meanwhile pricing could also be stronger this season thanks to factoring in numerous increased costs--everything from wood prices (used in both pallets and grape boxes) to freight prices, labor costs and more. 
 Wine grape growers in California and elsewhere face increasing labor costs and severe labor shortages, making it difficult to manage and harvest a vineyard while maintaining profitability. 
   Wine grape laborers have been virtually nonexistent. 
 The degree of labor reduction depends on growing region, grapevine type and the number of practices growers mechanize. 
 The review provides guidance on using machines for winter pruning, canopy management and harvesting as well as how to design a grape vineyard for machines before planting. 
About 90% of the wine grapes crushed in the U.S. are mechanically harvested.
   Using more mechanization in a vineyard beyond just harvesting can also reduce labor costs without affecting grape quality.   
 One experiment in the San Joaquin Valley, where more than 50% of California's wine grapes are grown, also showed using mechanical canopy management machines to manage merlot grapes resulted in twice the amount of color. 
 A winery in Lake County is suing a grape growing company for allegedly selling them smoke-tainted grapes, according to the North Bay Business Journal. 
Langtry Farms claims that grapes delivered to them by Santa Rosa-based Torick Farms (a company run by a former top executive with Jackson Family Wines) harvested during last year's wildfires ruined a number of tanks of wine.
 At a court hearing on May 20, Langtry Farms filed receipts from third-party test results showing high levels of taint in grape samples (allegedly taken from tanks associated with Torick Farms' grapes). 
 Torick Farms, however, presented evidence that the winery did not raise any concerns about the quality of their grapes at time of delivery. 
 Bieber smiled and said, “Ground Ball Grape.” 
Monday night it’s safe to say Bieber stayed with Ground Ball Grape.
A little Ground Ball Grape never hurts either.
 SACRAMENTO (CBS13) – Grapes are California’s third-largest crop, valued at nearly $6 billion a year. 
 “Our estimate is we have two-thirds less people working in wine grapes now,” said Prof. Kaan Kurtural, of the UC Davis Viticulture and Enology Department. 
So now more grape growers are turning to technology to harvest and maintain crops.
 Napa Valley growers often tie grape prices to wine market prices, using a rule of thumb that 1 ton of grapes ought to be priced at 100 times the retail price of the bottle they go into. 
 Using this guideline, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes priced at the 2019 district average of $8,000 might be expected to be used exclusively in wines selling for $80 per bottle. 
 After skyrocketing between 2012 and 2018, however, average Napa grape prices fell off in 2019 and plummeted in 2020 because of wildfires, in some instances leading to significant discounting at retail. 
 “We just need to be careful we don’t get too far out ahead of ourselves on grape pricing,” Robert Nicholson of International Wine Associates (IWA), a boutique M&A firm, told Wine Business Monthly. 
Nicholson was one of the speakers participating in an online seminar focused on vineyard values presented by Napa Valley Grapegrowers last week.
 The graphic below looks at Napa grape prices, tons and equivalent cases produced. 
 According to the CDFA/NASS's California Grape Crush Report, the average price of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa County exceeded $8,000 per ton in 2019. 
Adding up the case volumes of the top 22 Napa-based brands by volume indicates 1.2 million cases of Cabernet sold for an average of $47 per bottle—less than one might expect given where Napa grape prices were in 2018 and 2019.
 “There is a significant amount of value leakage if you think 1 percent is the right economic metric for valuing grapes,” Grace said. 
 The chart below shows values by location category compared to grape prices in those prime, secondary and outlying areas. 
 Correia said vineyards going for $500,000 an acre come with established histories of very high grape prices for very expensive bottles of wine. 
Area grape growers file lawsuit against Bayer-Monsanto and BASF over herbicide damage
 Grape growers on the South Plains are suing Bayer-Monsanto and BASF for damages to vineyards, which the grape growers say is caused by the cotton herbicide sold by Bayer-Monsanto and BASF. 
 The lawsuit claims that since Bayer-Monsanto and BASF began selling their dicamba-based genetically modified seed system to cotton growers in 2015 and 2016, the drifting dicamba herbicide has damaged nearby productive grapevines across the area. 
   The vineyards have seen their production fall dramatically, and what grapes do grow are often rejected for poor quality. 
   Contracts have been canceled,   it continues,   winemakers have had to seek grapes elsewhere, and a stigma has attached to the region. 
 Attorneys representing the grape growers say cotton seed systems created by Bayer-Monsanto and BASF feature the highly volatile herbicide called dicamba to kill weeds, and the herbicide is drifting to nearby vineyards, and crippling the nonresistant grapes. 
 Ted Liggett of the Liggett Law Group in Lubbock and Adam Dinnell of the Houston law firm Schiffer Hicks Johnson, both attorneys representing the grape growers, say Monsanto knew as early as 2009, years before the seed system was released, that dicamba was highly volatile and that it would have far reaching impacts on other crops. 
 Cliff Bingham of Bingham Family Vineyards in Meadow, and a plaintiff in the case, says his annual grape production has decreased from 800 tons to under 100 tons last year. 
 Fifty-seven wine grape growers representing about 3,000 acres of vines are part of the lawsuit, saying they've suffered $114 million in economic damages. 
 More than 85% of all the wine grapes grown in Texas are grown within one hour of Lubbock, and the grapes are produced, sold or used by the state's $13.1 billion wine industry. 
 This article draws on lessons from the current pandemic and previous agricultural blights, and explores bioinformational research directions aimed at future-proofing the grape and wine industry against biological shocks from global blights and climate change. 
 Grapeman Farms has a rich history in the grape category and working in the San Joaquin Valley, the area that produces approximately 99 percent of all table grapes in the U.S. 
 Currently, it’s about 15 percent through Mexico and then will turn its attention to California for the early San Joaquin Valley grape crop. 
 Looking at the early San Joaquin Valley grape crop, the company expects to be up in volume this year compared to 2020, and forecasts a high-quality crop. 
 “The early San Joaquin used to be a huge deal, but a lot of the early grapes have been removed due to production issues,” Lane said. 
He describes the grape market as being “pretty hot” right now and better than most years.
 “With things starting to open up, we’re hoping people will be out this summer in parks eating plenty of grapes,” Lane said. 
“Another issue with grapes is that 65 percent of input cost is labor and minimum wage jumped up a dollar so costs are quite a bit higher than it has been in year’s past and it’s been hard getting retailers to understand that.
 Retailers are attracted to the San Joaquin Valley’s grapes, he shared, because they like getting a fresher crop than what they would be getting importing in from other areas. 
 “The beigest thing the table grape industry is going for is the larger percentage of newer, higher-flavored varieties. 
 Other new varieties that Grapeman expects to do well include Allison’s, Ivory and Candy Snap, which is a sister grape of the popular Cotton Candy. 
 Chardonnay pomace, which is the solid remains of wine grapes after juicing, has been found to increase health benefits in humans, according to a study written by a food science research team at UC Davis. 
 Chardonnay pomace (or marc) consists of the seeds, flesh and skin of the grapes that are classified as waste and benefit one’s health. 
The pomace has been identified to be a product of winemaking that is about 30% of the grape’s original mass.
 Along with having health benefits, Chardonnay pomace can also be an ingredient for making grape seed oil, a source of food for livestock, and can be used to produce alcoholic beverages such as grappa. 
 This consisted of conducting a gross characterization of the grape marc to find the protein, fiber, fat and total carbohydrates, including analyzing the medium-sized carbohydrates called oligosaccharide compounds. 
 Since wine is a major industry in California, a large quantity of grape marc is being produced each year. 
These grape marcs are filled with bioactive compounds that could benefit human health and help feed people.

The Italian grape season is about to begin again at the Staay Food Group in the Netherlands.
 This week (23), we begin with the first beautiful Black Magic and Victoria grapes from Sicily. 
   Our Italian grapes will, again, be available under our three well-known brands - Didonna, Supreme, and our premium label, NERO Premium. 
This label's reserved for quality grapes from small-scale growers whim we personally selected.
   We get these top-quality grapes three to four times a week. 
 Programs also allow for 10x500g or 10x1kg trays,   says Sander, who's responsible for buying and selling the NERO premium grapes. 
That's one of Puglia's main grape suppliers.
Didonna grows a wide range of quality grapes for Staay Food Group.
 We offer these grapes in 7kg wooden crates, 5kg boxes, and EPS.

But grapes are grown just about everywhere and many wine grape varieties are well suited for non-coastal environments as well.
 In the High Plains region of Texas, just south of the Texas Panhandle, wine grape (and wine) production has been a recent local success story; Texas wines have even won awards held elsewhere. 
 In the larger wine-grape-growing regions of the United States, like in Northern California, dicamba drift has not been a substantial problem. 
 Napa and Sonoma counties in California, just for example, don’t have substantial dicamba-treated crops that close to the vineyards; there’s much more money to be made in growing grapes in those counties than growing cotton or soy. 
That release says that 57 Texas wine grape growers have filed suit against Bayer-Monsanto and BASF (which also sells dicamba products) for “hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The suit alleges that some grape growers saw a truly insane 90 percent reduction in their yield owing to dicamba drift.
 And grapevines, unlike some other crops, cannot simply be replanted the next year for a similar yield; they require decades to mature and produce the right quality of fruit for some wines. 
Grapevines have previously been known to be affected by dicamba drift.
 Grapes grown in Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other spots, have been known to suffer damage from dicamba. 
 “At Protofanousi Fruits, the largest Greek kiwifruit and cherry supplier and a force to be reckoned with in table grapes, we keep this quote close to heart because we know that leading does not come from playing it safe,” explains export director George Kallitsis. 
 Recognising the opportunities for Greek grapes, Proto is aiming for further expansion in the category. 
A brand-new table grape packing line from Marco UK is reportedly in the works and is set to be fully operational for the upcoming grape season.

The Austrian biotech company PhagoMed Biopharma is developing a viral protein that could one day treat the common condition bacterial vaginosis without disrupting the microbiome as traditional antibiotics do.
 PhagoMed has filed for a patent and established a team to develop the drug, which is designed to treat bacterial vaginosis by selectively killing a genus of bacteria called Gardnerella. 
 PhagoMed’s endolysin protein could solve these problems because it can kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria and also selectively kills Gardnerella bacteria, leaving benign bacteria, such as lactobacilli, unharmed. 
 “Phages and endolysins offer effective alternatives to antibiotics blunted by bacterial resistance,” said PhagoMed’s co-founder and Co-CEO, Lorenzo Corsini, in a statement. 
PhagoMed discovered the drug candidate by screening bacteriophages for proteins effective against Gardnerella and genetically engineering them to improve the protein’s shelf-life and antibacterial effects.
PhagoMed also has bacteriophage treatments in preclinical development for unspecified conditions.
PhagoMed’s endolysin protein does not have this problem because it can’t replicate but is still able to selectively kill Gardnerella bacteria.
PhagoMed is one of several companies testing the potential of bacteriophages to treat infections.

PHAGOMED ACCELERATES R&D PROGRAM AGAINST BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS.
 Vienna (Austria), 22 October 2019: Vienna-based biotech company PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH has discovered a novel drug candidate for the treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis and the re-stabilization of the vaginal microbiome. 
 With this new program, PhagoMed is extending its portfolio: in addition to therapies based on complete phages, the company now also develops a pharmaceutical based on a recombinantly expressed enzyme. 
The Vienna-based biotech company PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH is specialized on developing phage-based drug candidates for the treatment of severe bacterial infections in humans.
 “During our research into the field of Bacterial Vaginosis we came across a new type of phage endolysin, which was highly effective against Gardnerella bacteria”, explains PhagoMed’s co-founder and Co-CEO, Dr. Lorenzo Corsini. 
PhagoMed isolated Gardnerella-specific phage lysins and optimized them by genetic engineering.
On this basis PhagoMed has filed a patent application for this class of recombinant endolysins and established a dedicated team focused on the development of phages at the company’s headquarter at the Vienna Biocenter.
 To lead the team, PhagoMed successfully recruited Dr. Christine Landlinger-Schubert as the director of the lysin program. 
 Apart from the Bacterial Vaginosis program, PhagoMed has active development programs in the fields of urinary tract infections and implant-associated infections. 
PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH is an Austrian biotech company focused on the development of human therapeutic applications of phages and phage-derived proteins.
 Currently, PhagoMed has three active development programs in the fields of implant associated infections, urinary tract infections and Bacterial Vaginosis. 
 PhagoMed has a team of 15 highly skilled scientist working on its programs, eleven of which at the Campus Vienna Biocenter in Vienna, Austria. 
 Vienna (Austria), 27 June 2019: Austrian biotech company PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH successfully completed another financing round. 
 PhagoMed, located at the Vienna Biocenter, is focused on developing virus-(phage-) based therapies against drug-resistant and chronic bacterial infections. 
PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH (PhagoMed) works on solutions for the global antibiotics crisis – the increasing rate of multi-drug resistances against the historically so effective antibiotics.
 Indeed, PhagoMed’s co-founders have successfully treated individual patients with phages in Germany – as a last resort when antibiotics had failed. 
Already in 2018 PhagoMed successfully raised more than EUR 4 million in public grants and private investments and set up its research programs at the Vienna Biocenter.
 These results convinced both our existing and new investors to support our R&D activities with further equity investments”, says Alexander Belcredi, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of PhagoMed. 
One of the potent drug candidates identified by PhagoMed is specifically aimed at these infections and is now being validated in animal trials.
PhagoMed plans to start a first clinical trial in this indication by 2021.
PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH is an Austrian biotech company focused on the development of human therapeutic applications of phages and phage-derived proteins.

 A research and development team at PhagoMed Biopharma GmbH (Vienna, Austria) have proposed the use of a phage endolysin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. 
 Bacterial vaginosis affects between 10% and 30% of women worldwide, making it the most frequent vaginal infection and one of the top reasons for antibiotic prescriptions,” explained PhagoMed co-founder Lorenzo Corsini. 
 PhagoMed have genetically engineered the isolated Gardnerella-specific endolysin, optimizing it for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

 “Developing a phage drug would not have been possible a decade ago,” said Lorenzo Corsini, CEO of PhagoMed, an Austrian company working on phage therapies for urinary tract infections and medical implant-associated infections. 
While these therapies remain at an early stage – both PhagoMed’s products and most of BiomX’s chronic disease therapeutics are still in preclinical development – there is optimism.
 While Corsini and PhagoMed are bullish about the prospect, the reproducibility of such an off-the-shelf product in clinical settings remains yet to be proven.

Twenty-one members of the UNC Black Pioneers — an organization of Black alumni who graduated between 1952 and 1972 — released a statement on Wednesday calling on the Board of Trustees to take action in granting Nikole Hannah-Jones a tenured position at the University.
 “The undersigned members of the UNC Black Pioneers fully support the joint statement of support for tenure for Nikole Hannah-Jones issued by the Carolina Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists at UNC,” the statement read. 
 While the Powell Pioneers Legion Baseball team is no longer perfect, they continued their winning ways this past weekend. 
 In the Pioneers’ first game Saturday, stellar pitching from Brock Johnson kept the Cardinals in check. 
 Offensively, the Pioneers did enough to pick up the 4-0 win. 
 The Pioneers’ pitching staff struggled with command in the first inning, allowing several hits and walks, leading to the Cardinals crossing the plate six times in the opening frame. 
 Billings added five runs later in the game, creating an insurmountable deficit for the Pioneers. 
 The next day, the Pioneers finished the weekend on a high note. 
 Despite a release Cates described as “funky,” Flores has been a reliable arm for the Pioneers early in the season. 
 At 10-1, the Pioneers have been one of the best American Legion teams in the state, but Cates still sees several areas in which the team needs to grow. 
 Before conference play begins, the Pioneers will play two tournaments. 
 Early in the Powell Pioneers’ Saturday doubleheader against the Casper Drillers, it looked like their undefeated season was at risk. 
 Trailing 4-0 late in the game, the Pioneers couldn’t find a rhythm at the plate, thanks to a dominant performance on the hill by Casper starting pitcher Justin Wicks. 
 But when Casper opted to pull Wicks, the Pioneers found life. 
The Pioneers went on to defeat the Drillers 14-2 in game two of Saturday’s doubleheader before taking down Buffalo 18-0 and 17-3 on Sunday.
 The Pioneers wrapped up the weekend with another blowout, recording 21 hits in the 17-3 win. 
 Between the Pioneers’ four games, they scored 57 runs for an average of 14.25 per game. 
 With eight wins under their belts through eight games, the Pioneers have surpassed their win total from 2019, just two seasons ago. 
 That’s somewhat Pioneers’ fault, because the interface to do this is a mess. 
Mission accomplished after a 10-1 route of the Elmira Pioneers to get back in the win column.
 Pitchers allowing walks, errors in the field, and leaving too many runners on base have been the Muckdogs kryptonite ever since their last victory against the Pioneers at Dunn Field on opening night. 
 As we tiptoe tentatively toward a more normal semester, hopefully marked by sweet reunions, full classrooms and the feeling of togetherness, Chron15 aims to celebrate the pioneers, leaders and icons who make Duke the incredible, vibrant community that has persisted throughout this difficult year. 
 UPDATED: Olentangy Schools changing logos for Braves, Patriots, Pioneers Student-athletes share their perspectives 
 Although the school district is changing the logos for Olentangy, Liberty and Orange, the sports teams still will be known as the Braves, Patriots and Pioneers, which is consistent with the plan outlined several years ago when a strategic plan for the process was developed, district chief communications officer Krista Davis said. 
 Lauren Berend, who will be a senior at Orange, said she has warmed up to the new Pioneers logo and that it has even generated some ideas. 
   Changing from the Pioneer is a good look because astronauts are like modern-day Pioneers.

 NEW YORK — Linda Martell, one of the pioneers for Black acts in country music and the first Black woman to perform solo at the Grand Ole Opry, will be honored at the 2021 CMT Music Awards. 
 When Delta College's women's soccer team was told last summer that it couldn't officially practice together, the Pioneers' captains decided to take matters into their own hands. 
   We didn't even know if we'd get to play at all,   admitted Delta co-captain Elizabeth Green, a sophomore forward from Dow High, whose Pioneers beat Brookhaven College 4-1 on Saturday to win the National Junior College Athletic Association Division III national championship. 
 In early fall, the Pioneers were finally given the go-ahead to hold official non-contact practices, and after working out in the gym during the winter, full-contact practices began in March once it was announced that there would indeed be an abbreviated season this spring. 
 As the season progressed and the Pioneers kept winning, often by lopsided margins, the team began to sense that something special was within its grasp. 
But the Pioneers always found a way to stay on task -- just in case.
 As Nettles detailed in the second installment of the Black and Gold Club’s “Conversations with Pioneers” series, that was far from the most consequential way his experiences differed from those of current student-athletes. 
 “We had no idea about being pioneers or being the first,” Nettles said. 
 “Pioneers don’t often get to share in the spoils of their efforts,” Stokes said. 
The Pioneers trailed 6-5 going into the bottom of the seventh when they put together the game-winning rally.
The Pioneers answered with four runs in their half of the first.
The Pioneers tied it in the second after Hill led off with a single and later scored on Holderbach’s base knock.
 She speaks to The Drum about ZTE’s journey as one of the pioneers of digital transformation, and how it is positioning itself through its marketing and communications strategy as a leader in 5G. 
 Hill, the Ohio Athletic Conference Player of the Year, hit .449 with 18 doubles, three triples and one home run in his first season with the Pioneers. 
 If you've been wary of bluetooth mics until now, you might want to check out this device, the Mikme Pocket. 
 Well, priced at €369 the Mikme pocket looks to address Bluetooth’s traditional issues with regard to range, reliability and quality. 
This is performed at the end of the recording with Mikme’s patented ‘lost and found’ protocol.
 This little box and the associated app has a lot of functionality and I’m pleased to see that Mikme have dropped the original plan to make some of the features only available by subscription, everything is included in the up front cost. 
It’s lost and found protocol means that recording to devices without Bluetooth relies on post production processing of the original files recorded on the Mikme itself - nothing new.
The Mikme Pocket is something you don’t know you need until you try it.
 Created by a hardware startup in Vienna, Austria, this pocket-sized audio record is the second product in the Mikme line and, arguably, and it makes it easy to record meetings, vocals, and video soundtracks with a box the size of a pack of cigarettes. 
Other Gadgets Other Gadgets Mikme Pocket Mikme Pocket What is it?
G/O Media may get a commission Buy Mikme Pocket for $450 from Mikme
 A new device from Austria’s mikme, the mikme pocket (€369 or just under $450 USD), offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and quality in a very portable package, delivering what might just be the ultimate pocket sound solution for reporters, podcasters, video creators and more. 
 mikme pocket is small — about half the size of a smartphone, but square and probably twice as thick. 
 It’s not as compact as something like the Rode Wireless GO, but it contains onboard memory and a Bluetooth antenna, making it possible to both record locally and transmit audio directly to a connected smartphone from up to three mikme pockets at once. 
 The mikme pocket features a single button for control, as well as dedicated volume buttons, a 3.5mm headphone jack for monitoring audio, a micro-USB port for charging and for offloading files via physical connection, and Bluetooth pairing and power buttons. 
 In the box, mikme has also included a lavalier microphone with a mini XLR connector (which is the interface the pocket uses) and a clip and two windscreens for the mic. 
 The internal battery for the mikme pocket lasts up to 3.5 hours of recording time, and it can last for more than six months in standby mode between recordings, too. 
 The mikme pocket is a pretty unadorned black block, but its unassuming design is one of its strengths. 
 You can use the mikme pocket on its own, thanks to its 16GB of built-in local storage, but it really shines when used in tandem with the smartphone app. 
The mikme pocket and app also have a failsafe built in for filling in any gaps that might arise from any connection dropouts thanks to the local recording backup.
 Like all lavalier mics, you’ll get better results the closer you can place the actual mic capsule itself to a speaker’s mouth, but the mikme pocket produced exceptional clean-sounding, high-quality audio right out of the box — in environments that weren’t particularly sound-isolated or devoid of background noise. 
 The mikme app has built-in audio tweaking controls with a great visual interface that allows you to hear the effects of processing tweaks in real time, which is great for maximizing sound quality on the go before sharing clips and videos directly from your device to social networks or publishing platforms. 
 From on-phone shotgun mics, to handheld recorders and much more, there are plenty of options out there for capturing audio on-the-go, but the mikme pocket is the one that offers the best balance of very high-quality sound that’s essentially immediately ready to publish, in a package that’s both extremely easy to carry anywhere with you and that offers durability and user-friendliness to suit newcomers and experts alike. 
 There are plenty of portable audio recorders and microphones on the market, but Mikme goes a step beyond all of them.

 Mikme certainly feels premium, with its sturdy metal case and light weight. 
 Mikme's capsule is also contained in spider suspension, which minimizes extra noise while you hold and walk around with it. 
 Mikme's interface is relatively simple: Along the back, it has buttons for power and Bluetooth, a micro-USB charging port, a headphone jack for monitoring your recordings, and two buttons to control headphone volume and the microphone's gain. 
 To use Mikme with your iPhone, you first have to connect it as a Bluetooth device. 
 From there, you can trigger remote audio recordings on your Mikme or synchronize recordings that'll go to both your phone and the device. 
Then there's the app's most important feature: You can shoot a video using the Mikme as your source microphone.
 Just hit record and your phone will start capturing a video as usual, and the MikMe will also start recording. 
 In our noisy office kitchen, the MikMe managed to record incredibly clear audio as I walked about, something that my iPhone X could barely manage when I was standing right in front of it. 
 That, in a nutshell, is Mikme's main selling point. 
 With MikMe, you can get the superior audio track applied instantly. 
 Realistically, though, Mikme was never meant to replace something like that. 
 To give us a sense of what's possible, the company also produced several music videos recorded entirely with Mikme. 
 While Mikme is certainly expensive, its usefulness could be priceless to some. 
 For the past five years, Mikme has been chasing the dream of perfect mobile audio recording. 
 The Mikme Pocket is its spin on a wireless lavalier (or   lav  ), those tiny microphones you typically see attached to talk show hosts and broadcast reporters to capture everything they say. 
 As much as I liked the original Mikme microphone, it wasn't the most convenient thing to use for vlogging and reporting on the go. 
 The MikMe Pocket solves that issue, allowing you to capture high-quality 44.1kHz/24-bit dialog wirelessly over Bluetooth, while also keeping your hands free. 
The Mikme Pocket is a fairly nondescript box with a recording button front and center.
 This time around, Mikme didn't go to the trouble of building its own custom microphone.

 Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to demo the Mikme Pocket, but it's easy to see how it could be useful for YouTubers and reporters. 
 Starting next year, you'll also be able to switch the Mikme Pocket over to the Bluetooth hands free profile, which lowers the audio quality to 16kHz, but will let you use the device with any third-party app. 
 Professional users will likely appreciate some of the Mikme Pocket's more advanced features, including the ability to wirelessly monitor your recordings, as well as a 3.5mm stereo out connection for passing audio to cameras and mixers. 
 Mikme also plans to offer a   pro   version of its app with more capabilities, like recording a video with two of its microphones, livestreaming, video customization and custom branding for $9.90 a month. 
 You'll get a year of pro access with every Mikme Pocket, but after that you'll still have free access to basic features, like wireless recording and auto video syncing. 
 Mikme has already raised nearly $70,000 for the Pocket on Kickstarter, and it still has 28 days left to go on its campaign. 
 And if you want to go all out, there's the professional kit with two Mikme Pockets for around $660. 
 All of the bundles will cost around 30 percent more once the Mikme Pocket hits retail, so there's an incentive to jump in early. 
Mikme's wireless microphone was one of the most unique devices we saw last year.
Now Mikme is ready to make its device a lot more consumer friendly.
 It's dropping the price of the original microphone, now known as the Mikme BlackGold, to $299. 
 And it's introducing another model, the Mikme Silver, for $199. 
The Mikme Silver is basically a scaled down version of the original.
Both Mikme models will be able to take advantage of the new USB microphone feature.
 And not only will they be useful for in-home recording, but the Mikmes are also small enough to travel with easily. 
 All of a sudden, Mikme's products are now a triple threat: A great portable audio recorder; a way to make your smartphone videos instantly sound better; and a portable sound studio. 
 In addition to redesigning its mobile app, Mikme also announced that it'll be launching premium features in the first quarter of 2019. 
That includes things like manual focus; video streaming from Mikme's app; watermark branding; and automatic intro/outro bumpers in your videos.
 Now that it's cheaper and more capable, Mikme has transitioned from a niche product for early adopters to something that plenty of consumers could actually use. 
 You can pre-order the Mikme Silver on Indiegogo today, and it's expected to ship in November. 
 Enter Mikme, a portable audio recorder that can capture high-quality 24-bit/96 kHz audio with the press of a button and, most distinctively, it can also stream recordings over Bluetooth. 
 Mikme's iPhone app captures those wireless streams, or you can set it up as a Bluetooth microphone on your computer. 
 Mikme is kicking off an Indiegogo campaign today with the hopes of raising $25,000, which follows a failed Kickstarter campaign from last fall in which it tried to raise an ambitious $217,000 (it got up to $85,615 from backers). 
 You can snag a Mikme of your own for $169 from its Indiegogo page, and the company expects to ship the microphone later this fall.

 Founder Philipp Sonnleitner, formerly an engineer at the audio giant AKG, says he was inspired to create Mikme while playing the piano. 
 Mikme, on the other hand, is all about simplicity. 
 You can edit multiple audio tracks from Mikme's iPhone app (which is headed to Android soon), or just treat it as another audio source in your recording software of choice. 
You can take a look (and listen) to Mikme in action below.
 I've included a portion of audio recorded by Mikme, which sounds much more rich than the onboard microphone on my Sony Alpha 6000. 
 Like most specialized audio gear, Mikme isn't for everyone. 
 Right now we're just hearing recordings from prototype Mikme hardware, so we'll reserve full judgement until we get our hands on a more final version. 
mikme is a wireless microphone that seamlessly brings studio-quality audio to your iPhone videos.
 it wirelessly streams audio to the mikme creator app, which syncs video from the smartphone with audio in real- time – ready for editing and sharing on the fly. 
 ‘let’s say you want to create a stunning video,’ explains the mikme website. 
Mikme wireless mic hands-on: recording studio in your pocket
 Fortunately, there’s Mikme, a successfully crowdfunded wireless microphone that delivers studio-grade audio recording capabilities in a box not that much bigger than your iPhone. 
 Mikme, in contrast, is able to isolate sounds, like your voice, from ambient noise and make the foreground really pop. 
 Unlike most external mic accessories for smartphones, Mikme has a true condenser, 1-inch in diameter, gold-plated, and suspended in the air via a spider-like structure to prevent handling noise from interfering. 
 Fortunately, you directly record on the Mikme’s 16 GB storage. 
 Ideal as Mikme might sound, no pun intended, there are still a few things that need to be done. 
The small team of 9 also want to be able to connect Mikme to a camera via Bluetooth.
 The Mikme Wireless Mic does cost quite a bit, $499 on B&H Photo, but if you’re in the market for studio quality audio recording on the go, it’s far cheaper than whatever professional equipment is out there. 
 Editor's Note: On July 17, Mikme announced its more-affordable $199 Mikme Silver, dropped the price of the original Mikme to $299, and added a new USB microphone recording mode. 
 That's why I'm pretty impressed by the latest update to the Mikme wireless microphone, which I tested this past weekend. 
But this new update arguably makes the Mikme even more important and interesting.
 Now users can use the Mikme's iOS app to record video with their iPhone cameras while the Mikme records the accompanying audio, and the Mikme app will sew the two streams together after you're done shooting. 
 To see how well it worked, I brought the Mikme to the Washington Square Arch in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, where I asked a friend to stand near a young busker as I walked around the perimeter of the arch, recording the scene — and the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's metallic statue nearby — on my iPhone. 
 The Mikme captures high-resolution audio with its on-board analogue-to-digital converter, showing you the audio levels and using a unique Bluetooth protocol for greater stability. 
Here's a sample clip from the Mikme team of how great your finished video product can look with the speaker:
 After you first pair your iPhone and your Mikme via Bluetooth, recording the audio and video tracks simultaneously is super easy. 
 You just open the Mikme app, tap Video and hit the record button. 
(Gain can be controlled from two buttons on the rear of the Mikme.)
 When you tap stop, the Mikme iOS app pulls the audio file from the microphone to pair it with the video file. 
 According to MacRumors, way back in 2008, before the iPhone was even a gleam in Steve Jobs’ eye, Apple was toying with the idea of building an electric car. 
 There are more palm trees and drought-tolerant plantings in the front yard, along with the deep emerald gleam of artificial turf. 
 Ralph Fiennes speaks these lines on a stage furnished with only a table and two chairs; lighting effects, from sunsets to the fiery red of a bombing raid, gleam behind him. 
A 5-star sword called the “Mist-Cutting Gleam” will presumably be added to the game in a future patch.
 Allegedly, “Mist-Cutting Gleam” is able to build up stacks of “Mist-Cutting Tomoemon” that increases the Elemental DMG% bonus of its wielder on a per-stack basis. 
 However, judging by the design and the Crit DMG% substat, it might fall under the same weapon set as “Mist-Cutting Gleam,” similar to the “Song of Broken Pines” claymore and the new “Freedom Sworn” sword. 
 Rumors speculate that a new 5-star sword, “Mist-Cutting Gleam,” will be one of several new weapons coming to Genshin Impact. 
Mist-Cutting Gleam and other new 5-star weapons
 According to reputable leaks, a new 5-star sword called “Mist-Cutting Gleam” will arrive to Genshin Impact. 
 It’s possible that this bow has the same ability as Mist-Cutting Gleam, much like how the Dragonspine weapons had the same abilities. 
But no one gives a flying bird about Altaria’s Dazzling Gleam.
“BUT IT ALREADY HAS DAZZLING GLEAM!!”
Dazzling Gleam Moonblast DMG 110 110 Energy Cost 70 60 Stat buff/debuff?
It is clear that Moonblast is a superior second charged move when compared to Dazzling Gleam or Dragon Pulse.
 Considering a 1 shield scenario, with Dragon Breath paired with Sky Attack and Dazzling Gleam, Altaria gets a 77% win rate against the meta: 
 Under the 1 shield scenario with Dragon Breath paired with Sky Attack and Dazzling Gleam, Altaria has a 62.6% win rate against the meta:

Only the metallic gleam at the base of each piece gives the game away.
The second charge move should be Dazzling Gleam.

 At the request of Councilmember Gleam Davis, Council will discuss possibly directing staff to return with proposed amendments that would allow the home-sharing of detached accessory buildings as long as they are located more than six feet from the main building that’s occupied by the host who wishes to home-share the accessory building. 
 Marty Schottenheimer famously told his Browns,   There's a gleam, men. 
   I think we all just assumed that the gleam was the shine off the Super Bowl trophy,   the former Cleveland Pro Bowl defensive tackle under Schottenheimer said Tuesday. 
   But it was something that just said, we're working together, there's something waiting at the end of this, that we're just absolutely driving for -- that gleam.   
But the gleam was never just about a trophy anyway.
 As his former Cleveland players remembered Schottenheimer this week, they kept coming back to another gleam. 
Golic too remembered that gleam well.
 Marty Schottenheimer's driving, energetic style personified what came to be known as   Martyball,   but through all his coaching stops, he still always had the gleam. 
   That gleam of his eyes, still then, even with this tragic, sad disease ... 
had already taken effect on him and his body -- yet he still had that beautiful gleam in his eyes.
   And that's what I'd like to just keep remembering -- that gleam in Marty Schottenheimer's eyes.   
 The outside Guardians all gleam in their sapphic splendor, and the styles are, of course, to die for. 
 Other fundamental highlights incorporate optical consistency which is identified with gleam, and geometrical consistency which is identified with smoothness and printability. 
 This time around, the brother-duo seemed to know that when releasing the third installment of “The Gleam” series in the middle of a pandemic, it was not the time to go big. 
 Instead, the Avett Brothers returned to their roots in “The Third Gleam,” composing a beautiful and heartfelt eight-track album, touching on subjects they know well — family, faith, aging and love. 
 However, with “The Third Gleam,” the Avett Brothers manage to return to their old folk sound and improve upon their political statement all at once. 
 If you want a lovely, cohesive experience with “The Third Gleam,” just go ahead and skip “Women Like You.” 
 “The Third Gleam” calls back to the simple sounds of the 2008 and 2006 releases “The Second Gleam” and “The Gleam,” while managing to incorporate growth — both personal and musical. 
 Charged move possibilities include Dragon Pulse, Dazzling Gleam, and Sky Attack. 
 The last (top) pick we have for Shadow Pokemon against Altaria is Shadow Gardevoir, with Charm and Dazzling Gleam.

 Dominic Smales, the founder of U.K.-based digital talent management firm Gleam Futures — and a key architect behind the careers of several of YouTube‘s earliest stars, including the Pixiwoo sisters, Zoe Sugg, and Marcus Butler — is stepping down from his post as CEO, effectively immediately. 
Gleam was founded by Smales in 2010 and acquired by ad giant Dentsu Aegis in 2017.
 Last April, the company launched Gleam Entertainment — a 360-degree talent management arm for celebrities who began their careers on mainstream platforms. 
 Prior to that, it had launched an influencer marketing division dubbed Gleam Solutions in May 2019. 
 In a LinkedIn post, Smales mused about breaking new ground with the sisters and other Gleam clients over the years, including the development of their multimillion dollar beauty brand, Real Techniques, as well as forays into the book business (with Alfie Deyes‘ The Pointless Book) and feature films (Joe And Caspar Hit The Road). 
 In Smales’ absence, COO Phil Hughes has been appointed Gleam’s chief commercial officer, while global head of talent Lucy Loveridge has been upped to managing partner. 
 Both will lead Gleam going forward, reporting to James Morris, Dentsu International’s CEO of creative for the U.K. and Ireland. 
 “Despite the complexities of the year, Gleam continues to go from strength to strength, having its most successful year to date in 2020,” Morris said in a statement. 
“We are extremely optimistic about the prospects for the future of Gleam within Dentsu and look forward to building on this success with Lucy and Phil.”
 Elspeth Rae and Bronagh Monahan, former Gleam Futures and Endemol Shine talent managers, have launched the talent and entertainment company MonRae Management. 
 Monahan (left) first started managing talent at Gleam Futures UK, leading international tours such as Hit The Road USA with Caspar Lee and Joe Sugg, and brokering global endorsement deals with the likes of Coca-Cola and L’Oréal. 
 For example, “A Young Man Resting on an Exercise Bike, Amityville, NY” (1988) gives us an abundance from its somewhat stoic-seeming subject: his gentle but pointed gaze, his long fingers, the gleam of his bike’s steel handlebars. 
Abigail Bergstrom is leaving her role as head of publishing at Gleam Titles following five years with the company.
Abigail Bergstrom is leaving her role as head of publishing at Gleam Titles following five years with the company.
 She joined in 2016, when the company launched its literary arm, Gleam Titles, which represents Mrs Hinch, Scarlett Curtis, as well as Anna Whitehouse and Matt Farquharson. 
 Bergstrom, who was nominated for Literary Agent of the Year at the 2020 British Book Awards and listed in The Bookseller 150, said: “Working at Gleam has been an incredible ride and undoubtedly the most thrilling experience of my professional career. 
Her final day at Gleam Futures is 19th May. She declined to comment on her future plans.
 Phil Hughes, chief commercial officer of Gleam Futures, said: “Abigail is leaving Gleam Titles as a business in an incredibly strong and exciting position, as it goes from strength to strength with a world beating and growing roster. 
We’re really grateful for everything that Abigail has done for Gleam Futures in building Gleam Titles.
Gleam Futures is now recruiting for a new head of publishing to succeed Bergstrom.
 Laura McNeill joined Gleam Titles as literary agent at the beginning of 2020 and is continuing to build and grow her list, which includes astrophysicist Dr Becky Smethurst and illustrator Amber Fossey. 
Gleam Futures launched in 2010 as a media and entertainment agency and was one of the first businesses to focus on digital-first talent.
 Ben Malka, senior talent manager at Gleam Futures, joined the team when he was headhunted to help build out Gleam’s gaming division. 
 At the end of February, the digital-first talent management agency announced the launch of Gleam Game.

 Despite Ben’s hectic schedule, managing family life alongside his new role in the Gleam Game division, he helps the new division to excel by keeping his finger on the pulse and building valuable connections with the talent that he manages. 
Dazzling Gleam (Fairy-type) – 110 damage and 70 energy
Moonblast is better than dazzling gleam because it costs 10 less energy.
The sparkly gleam and sheen of it elevate your style aesthetics and the figure-flattering silhouette can make you look like a diva.
 But their musings on the bleak state of the world and American politics sound much less strained on The Third Gleam, their 10th studio album and the highly anticipated (at least among fans) third installment in the Gleam series, which, in its first two iterations released in 2006 and 2008, respectively, brought us beauties like “If It’s The Beaches” and Avett classics like “Souls Like The Wheels.” 
 While The Avett Brothers lineup typically consists of a robust group of players including fiddler Tania Elizabeth and cellist Joe Kwon, The Third Gleam finds Scott and Seth Avett playing in a paired-down trio with longtime bassist Bob Crawford. 
 But The Third Gleam is not a record of punk songs (like those Scott and Seth might’ve played in their first band in the early 2000s, a punk rock group called Nemo) or country-rock rambles. 
 On The Third Gleam, The Avett Brothers take a step back from all that gloss and shine and just focus on the songwriting, the harmonies and the dynamic between three musicians in a room. 
 Hearing The Third Gleam is like stepping into a sunny, peaceful clearing after hours of running through the woods. 
The “Untitled 4” track is fittingly the thematic and sonic center of The Third Gleam.
Trality is an Austrian company founded in 2018 by Christopher Helf and Moritz Ptzhammer.
The Trality platform has become popular due to its flexibility and ease of use.
Another great advantage of the Trality platform is its paper trading and backtesting capabilities.
The Trality platform lets you see how your trading strategies and algorithms would have performed historically and then practice trading using virtual money before you commit any funds.
Trality offers a range of pricing for 4 subscription service plans with different features.
Trality’s different payment plans are named for chess pieces and start with the free Pawn service.
You can review Trality’s different payment plans and offerings below:
The cost of each payment plan that was listed on the Trality website in euros was converted into U.S. dollars at the current EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.21 for placement in the table above.
 Trality supports intervals of 1, 5, 15 and 30 minutes; 1, 6 and 12 hours; and 1 day. 
Trality stores logs for a certain time in most plans or for an unlimited time in the most costly plan.
Trality works hard to make sure all users get the help they need.
 Furthermore, if you need to chat one-to-one with Trality, they have support email addresses for urgent and more personal queries at support@trality.com. 
 Trality does not yet offer a mobile app, although the option is apparently under development. 
The company is also developing the Trality Bot Marketplace to either publish your bot or follow bots coded by other creators.
Trality’s cloud based platform lets you implement your trading strategies directly on your Web browser without the need for extensive software downloads.
 Trality also lets you backtest and test your bot in real market conditions with virtual money, so you don’t have to risk your funds before your bot has been thoroughly vetted. 
Advanced users can take advantage of Trality’s Python Augmented Code Editor that has a user friendly interface and excellent Python API functionality.
You can sign up and try Trality for free using virtual money to paper trade.
 Because your funds stay deposited at your crypto exchange, Trality does not expose them to risks other than the significant market risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies and the possibility that your algorithm’s code might contain an error. 
 Your funds are also never touched directly by Trality, and the platform only uses official exchange APIs. 
 For additional security, your trading bots and strategies are end-to-end encrypted, so even Trality can’t access them. 
The overall rating for Trality is good and if it had a mobile app and few more exchanges then we could probably give it 5 stars.
 Trality compares favorably against most competitors, especially because of the platform’s intuitive interface and the ability to build bots with its drag and drop feature. 
Trality will become more competitive with the release of its upcoming Bot Marketplace and mobile application that are currently under development.
Its free paper trading and backtesting features could be invaluable in trading strategy development and give you the opportunity to try Trality’s platform without obligation.

 Trality, a Fintech developing a trading bot for crypto, has raised €1.5 million to further advance its platform. 
Trality says it is now making robo trading available to any private investor and trader.

 With Trality, we offer a smarter alternative to manually investing and without the high entry costs,” says Moritz Putzhammer, co-founder of Trality. 
 Trality does not trade crypto assets itself but rather, allows users to connect their bots to a list of leading partner exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitpanda. 
 “Specifically, Trality wants to target less-experienced users with the help of a ‘marketplace’. 
Trality was founded in Vienna in January 2019 by Putzhammer and Christopher Helf.
 Despite having a relatively small startup ecosystem, Austria has nevertheless managed to produce several fintech winners, including Bitpanda, Trality and Blockpit, the report says.

The Viennese FinTech startup Trality aims to transform the market by making bot trading accessible to a broad public.

 The FitTrack Dara is a part of the broader FitTrack household, which incorporates the Aria sensible watch, the Beebo household sensible scale and the Tempo thermometer. 
FitTrack additionally presents a lifetime warranty called FitCare+ to guard your units eternally.
 For a more complete picture, you might want to consider investing in a smart scale like the $89.95 FitTrack Dara, which tracks 17 metrics, including your basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, body water percentage, bone mass, fat mass, metabolic age, muscle mass, muscle rate, protein mass, protein rate, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, weight without fat, and, of course, your actual weight (up to 400 pounds). 
 The FitTrack Dara is a compact smart scale, measuring just 10.23 by 10.23 inches (HW). 
 Looks-wise, the FitTrack Dara features an attractive white-and-silver design reminiscent of the $79.99 Arboleaf Smart Fitness Scale, only smaller. 
 Left to right: Arboleaf Smart Fitness Scale, FitTrack Dara 
 Unlike some other smart scales that are rechargeable, like the QardioBase 2, the FitTrack Dara is powered by 4 AAA batteries, which aren't included in the box. 
 Without pairing the scale to the FitTrack Pro app (available for Android and iOS), it will only show your body weight. 
 The FitTrack Dara connects to your phone via Bluetooth, not Wi-Fi, so it will only send your measurements to the app if your phone is within the limited Bluetooth range. 
 Then open the FitTrack Dara app on your phone, step on the scale with bare feet, stand up tall, and make sure both of your feet are uniformly situated over the metal electrodes. 
 When it displays your weight again, the analysis is complete, and you can see all your measurements in the FitTrack Pro app. 
 FitTrack recommends using the scale at the same time, under the same conditions each day. 
 Just tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the app's Home tab, select Weigh Infant, step on the scale by yourself to measure your weight, then step on the scale with the baby in your arms, and the FitTrack Dara will measure your little one's weight. 
 There are three tabs at the bottom of the FitTrack Pro app: Home, which shows your latest measurements; History, where all your metrics are stored; and Me, where you can manage users and other settings. 
 In the FitTrack Pro app's History tab, you can track your results over the past day, week, month, and year. 
 In Me, you can create profiles for other users and add them to your account, set reminders to take your measurements every morning and/or night, change your units of measurement, connect to your scale via Bluetooth, submit feedback for FitTrack, and access FAQs. 
 If another person in your household wants to use the scale and keep their metrics private, they can download the FitTrack Pro app on their own phone, and connect to the scale via Bluetooth. 
 As is customary for smart scales, the FitTrack Dara determines your body fat percentage using a process called bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), which involves sending a low-level electrical current through your body. 
FitTrack also recommends avoiding the scale if you have osteoporosis.
 There's no evidence that this process is dangerous for pregnant women, but FitTrack recommends consulting your doctor before using the scale if you're expecting. 
 Some other smart scales feature a safe mode for pregnant women and people who wear pacemakers, but the FitTrack Dara doesn't. 
 If you're in the market for a smart scale that can help you understand your body composition, the $89.95 FitTrack Dara is a strong choice. 
 And for far less money, the Wyze Scale is suitable for use by pregnant women and people with pacemakers, though it measures fewer metrics than the FitTrack Dara.

Three Standout Features of the FitTrack Dara BMI Smart Scale
 Many customers have applauded the FitTrack Dara for accuracy; however, some factors could affect your body composition's final results. 
 The FitTrack Dara BMI smart scale uses an electrical signal that relays information quickly through water in your abdomen, the electrical signals could change if you are dehydrated. 
 Therefore, it is important to hydrate a few minutes before stepping on the scale to avoid making the FitTrack Dara smart scale think you have more fat than you do. 
 Even though scale fittrack Dara promises to give accurate results any time of the day, specialists advocate that you step into the smart scale at a specific time for more accurate results. 
Most people prefer using the FitTrack bathroom scale in the morning after getting out of the bathroom.
 If you decide to purchase two smart scales from the manufacturer, you will get the second product 50% off the buying price, and if you purchase three, you may earn the third FitTrack free. 
Safety Precautions When Using the FitTrack Smart Scales
 Before using The FitTrack, make sure that it stands on an even surface; also, wait for ten seconds before you can step on the scales to measure weight. 
 When storing the FitTrack scales, remove the batteries and keep them in a dry room; extreme moisture, lint, heat, dust, or direct sunlight could interfere with this product's functionality. 
Things That Must Be Followed When Using the FitTrack Smart Scale
 The FitTrack Dara BMI smart scales do not have waterproof features; never immerse it inside the water; when cleaning it, soak a cloth quickly through water and use it to wipe it and not use soap or other detergents.

 NAME: Stout, Klaiton Alyn; 18; Salina 
 BOUGHT by his Grandfather in 1945 as a World War 2 surplus, the Jeep has gone through an extensive makeover since Klaiton took ownership. 
 The boys fabricated everything themselves and originally built the car for his Dad to take on Drag Week in 2016, but after breaking a rocker arm it was parked for two years until Klaiton decided the thrash on it for this year’s event. 
 The boys battled a wave of issues throughout drag week this year, from re-occuring oil leaks to broken U joints to re-doing the entire brake system to pass tech inspection, Klaiton and his mates had just about everything thrown at them. 
 The Hoonigans Riders Club, which is based at The Commercial Inn, in Redgate Street, were approached by Klaiton’s family as he wanted to attend the Elmwood School prom on the back of a trike. 
Club president Joey ‘Tank’ Webb said: “Klaiton’s family first got in touch via Facebook as he is a huge motorcycle fan and hoped to attend his school prom on the back on the bike.
 “Klaiton is a fantastic lad, entered the prom in style and has become an honorary member of the club.” 
 In the end, Klaiton rocked up to the prom with an escort of no less than 16 motorbikes. 
Klaiton’s mum Tracy Dalton said she is grateful for what the Hoonigans have done as it made Klaiton’s day.
He said: “They are a really good bunch of lads and what they did for Klaiton and the work they do for the community is fantastic.

 Siemens (www.Siemens.com) and HELIOZ collaborate to provide safe drinking water in Sudan; Siemens will sponsor a “WASH” campaign to provide water to marginalized Sudanese residents; easy-to-use solution for water disinfection, WADI will be implemented 
 Siemens has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with HELIOZ, a Social Enterprise company that is active in the field of water disinfection and development of climate projects, to provide safe drinking water to the marginalized Sudanese residents of Khartoum, where there is no access to potable water. 
 Recognizing the dire need of clean drinking water in many parts of Sudan, Siemens has engaged with HELIOZ to contribute to changing the water crisis, by sponsoring a “WASH” campaign aimed at providing a solution that will deliver drinkable water to these marginalized communities in Khartoum. 
 The project, which is developed by HELIOZ will be rolled out to beneficiaries in two phases. 
 In a second step, Siemens and HELIOZ aim to extend the initiative to Kosti in White Nile State where Siemens is already engaged in the upgrade and renovation of two schools. 
 WADI, which has been tested and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), as an effective method for household water, was specifically designed by HELIOZ for communities that require an easy-to-use solution for water disinfection. 
Our collaboration with HELIOZ on this project solidifies our commitment to address basic human needs and essential infrastructure for the advancement of communities and regions we operate.
 Siemens – in partnership with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), which is working on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), as well as HELIOZ, and Plan International – has developed multiple programs that deliver humanitarian, economic and educational benefits to the marginalized people of Sudan. 
 Siemens signed an agreement on July 31 with HELIOZ , a social enterprise active in the field of water disinfection and development of climate proj­ects, to develop a multi-year water, sanitation and hygiene ( WASH ) program for marginalized residents of Khartoum, as well as Kosti in White Nile State where there is no access to potable water.

ALPLA has selected specific projects in cooperation with the climate neutrality alliance Klimaneutralitätsbündnis 2025 and non-governmental organization (NGO) Helioz.
 In regions in Asia and Africa, ALPLA is supporting Helioz, which provides solar devices that monitor water disinfection using PET bottles. 
Helioz was first approved by the FDA in 2014 as the first treatment for blind people who are experiencing a disrupted body clock and irregular sleep patterns.
 Martin Wesian, founder of Helioz, is perhaps the best known social entrepreneur in Austria. 
 Helioz has developed Wadi, a solar-powered electronic device for enabling individuals to safely disinfect drinking water in PET bottles, using only the sun’s energy. 
 This brilliant and efficient portable device has earned Helioz multiple awards and recognition, as well as venture capital to develop the product. 
 Now at the cusp of mass production and international distribution, the Wadi is poised to take Helioz and Wesian to a higher level, as well as help millions worldwide live healthier with potable drinking water. 
 Martin Wesian, founder of Helioz and Wadi. 
 Credit: Michael BernsteinDespite having enough R&D money, Helioz had no budget to speak of for marketing and PR. 
Wadi/Helioz kept winning awards and competitions.
 The first Wadi units were (and to this day continue to be) made by hand in the cellar of Helioz’s office space, often by Wesian himself. 
Increasing demand made it clear that Helioz would need venture capital investment to mass produce Wadi at an affordable price.
Eventually Helioz entered into an equity partnership with a major Austrian industrial company.
 A large Austrian manufacturing company, who were also supportive of the humanitarian goals of Helioz, was contracted to mass produce 200.000 units. 
 Suddenly, the investor hesitated, insisting that Helioz first obtain confirmed orders, not just LOIs, for the entire production run. 
 Despite receiving another 100.000 confirmed orders from Pakistan in October, production couldn’t begin and Helioz had to break the news to its customers, hoping they wouldn’t jump ship to a rival product such as PotaVida (who, Wesian believes, may have infringed on Wadi’s patents). 
 I’ve considered this, but for a R&D firm like Helioz in Austria, it’s not a good idea. 
 He can foresee Helioz not just developing its own devices to satisfy the BOP market’s clear needs, but to leverage the distribution channels developed for Wadi to market products made by others as well. 
 As an elder statesman on the Austrian social enterprise scene, Helioz is well-positioned to lend its advice to others. 
 If approved, Helioz would be the first drug registered for N24, which causes insomnia at night and excessive sleepiness in the daytime and is termed an   invisible disability  , with a dramatic impact on the well-being and social functioning of people with the condition. 
The FDA is due to deliver its verdict on Hetlioz by the end of January and - if positive - some analysts have predicted that Helioz could achieve sales of $200m a year or more at peak.

 Finally, Helioz, an Austrian social enterprise working in the field of water disinfection and climate project development, relies on environmentally friendly solutions for water disinfection. 
 These went to Finley Baker, Gracie Kadar, Olivia Tunnicliffe, Henry Lammas, Molly Curle, Chloe Polaine, Lilly Slattery, Nicholas Helioz, Ethan Kirk, Khy Cipov and Alfie Heath. 
That is why Austrian startup Helioz (read more about them here and here) is raising money on the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo.
Team Helioz Photo credit: Helioz GmbHBackers can donate between 5 and 10.000 euros.
Helioz’s Indiegogo campaign doesn’t follow the all-or-nothing crowdfunding strategy but allows for flexible funding.
 Another two partners, the Vienna-based NGO GEZA and the Indian social business Samvab will help the Helioz team during the implementation in India. 
 However, Wadi is a solar-powered portable gadget developed by the Vienna-based Helioz startup, which measures the UV radiation hitting the bottle and determines exactly how long the water needs to be in the sun and lets users know when it’s ready to drink. 
 Helioz founder Martin Wesian caught cholera when travelling in Venezuela after drinking contaminated water, and since then was inspired to find innovative solutions to reducing waterborne diseases. 
 FFG was founded in 2004, and has helped startups like Helioz (solar energy). 
 The manufacturer of WADI, Helioz, provides a two-year guarantee; but expects the device to have a longer service life.

 While Transferwise has been successful at helping consumers solve these issues, Paris-based iBanFirst is attacking the problem for corporations that need to make frequent transfers of much larger sums. 
Now iBanFirst is planning to accelerate that growth by expanding its reach across Europe through a series of acquisitions designed to consolidate these services and help enterprises manage the cost and complexity of international transfers.
 “People trust more and more that the internet is able to do international payments, and they trust us to do it,” iBanFirst CEO and founder Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier told VentureBeat. 
 To fuel that strategy, iBanFirst today announced a wide-ranging financial partnership with Marlin Equity Partners valued at $243 million. 
iBanFirst augments this traditional system by creating greater visibility.
iBanFirst connects customers directly to currency trading desks to get faster service.
 Marlin Equity Partners, a global investment firm, signed an agreement to complete a growth investment in iBanFirst SA (‘iBanFirst’), a cloud-based, payment institution delivering solutions across borders, to fund product development, international expansion and M&A. 
iBanFirst delivers payment solutions through its specialist online platform for multicurrency transactions.
 As an alternative to the traditional bank offering, iBanFirst enables a payment experience and related package of financial services that address the needs of SMEs in their daily operations. 
 Founded in Paris in 2013 by former bank executives and entrepreneurs, iBanFirst is a Belgian company, with operations in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. 
 At present, the market is developing its presence and some of the key players from the complete study are 4C, BECKON, BLUECONIC, Conversion Logic, Catalina Marketing, Core Digital Media, Data Plus Math, Disqo, Gravy Analytics, HAVI, iBanFirst.com, INFUSEmedia, Infutor Data Solutions LLC

 Creating the ‘Payment Tracker’ required the reconciliation of different types of payment status - SWIFT and iBanFirst - as well as giving secure access to this information outside the platform, in order for payment beneficiaries to use the service, not solely iBanFirst clients. 
 Commenting on the launch, Oualid Abderrazek, Chief Product Officer, iBanFirst said: “Until now, little had been done to provide real-time status updates on international bank transfers for both payers and payees. 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and Founder of iBanFirst, said: “We are delighted to launch the iBanFirst ‘Payment Tracker’, which brings a time-honoured tracking experience from the parcel delivery industry to cross-border payments.

 In a press release, iBanFirst reports the volume of payment transactions has almost tripled, with a year-on-year increase averaging 180 percent this past March. 
 In the latest development, iBanFirst, a global financial services provider has raised €21 million in a Series C round from Elaia and Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund. 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and Founder of iBanfirst, said: “Elaia and Bpifrance, notably through its Large Venture fund, are two major players in French venture capital and their ability to support the entrepreneurs and companies they invest in is well established. 
iBanFirst appoints former Microsoft engineer Yann Stadnicki as CDO
 Former Silicon Valley technologist and Microsoft research engineer, Yann Stadnicki, has joined iBanFirst as chief data officer (CDO) 
 New iBanFirst CDO Stadnicki, who joins from Microsoft, will be responsible for managing business intelligence, business analytics and data engineering teams at the Paris-based global financial services provider. 
 The appointment comes as part of iBanFirst’s data-driven hyper-growth financial services strategy, and follows three-figure revenue growth, as well as the announcement of its latest funding round. 
 “I’m delighted to join the iBanFirst team to fuel its growth in Europe and on a global basis, to achieve its global ambition of becoming number 1 in FX payments,” said new CDO Stadnicki. 
 “I was attracted by iBanFirst’s already fast-growing business, and through applying emerging technologies – within the context of the new European Directive and the open banking framework – we can now support its hyper-growth trajectory.” 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO of iBanFirst, commented: “As we navigate the ’new normal’, innovations in the Fintech sector will have a truly transformative impact on small and medium-sized businesses and their ability to make cost-efficient payments. 
 “At iBanFirst, we understand the importance of embracing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data orchestration to optimise the experience of our customers. 
The new hire is a great asset to the iBanFirst business and is part of our hyper-growth strategy.
 Brussels-based Fintech firm iBanFirst has secured €21 million in capital through a Series C round, which was led by Elaia and Bpifrance Large Venture. 
The funds raised will be used to expand iBanFirst’s financial services platform for SMEs.
“This is why we … support iBanFirst in its international growth and in the development of a leading pan- European digital platform.”
 iBanFirst had acquired €17 million capital nearly two years back, and has expanded its business by making two key acquisitions toward the end of last year. 
iBanFirst acquired Dutch firm Nederlandsche Betaal & Wisselmaatschappij and Berlin’s Forexfix.
 iBanFirst, global financial services provider delivering solutions across banking borders, today announced the acquisition of NBWM, first foreign exchange start-up in the Netherlands with more than 1,000 clients. 
 Following this move, NBWM’s clients will benefit from iBanFirst’s award winning online platform, a one-stop shop interface to receive and make cross-border payments, hedge foreign exchange risks and finance their international growth. 
“Taking over NBWM and establishing itself in the Netherlands falls within the scope of iBanFirst’s stated ambition to increase its geographical footprint in European since its second round of funding in November 2018.”
 said Dennis Malamatinas, Chairman of iBanFirst, and former CEO of Burger King Corporation and Smirnoff Vodka. 
“This acquisition represents a clear change of scale for iBanFirst as it will therefore process 5 billion euros in payments a year.”
 The founders of iBanFirst and NBWM have worked together at Saxo Bank in the past, as French and Dutch counterparts, and followed parallel journeys since. 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and founder of iBanFirst said: “I have known PJ Datema and Peter Comstock for a long time. 
Both companies will operate under the iBanFirst brand and iBanFirst will use NBWM’s Amsterdam office until mid-2020.
 However, they will take advantage of more services such as nominative IBANs, more hedging solutions and appreciate the user-friendly interface of the iBanFirst platform to make their transactions and international payments. 
 iBanFirst’s 100 per cent year-on-year growth has been fuelled by a massive investment in its platform and online solutions to offer an ever-broader range financial services to companies, making both fintechs complementary. 
“The combination of technology and personal service is exactly what we have in common with iBanFirst and what makes it a perfect match.
With the leading technology platform from iBanFirst our clients will benefit from the newest features in the field of payment transactions.
 Looking back on of NBWM’s and iBanFirst’s respective paths and considering their joint future, PJ Datema, founder of NBWM said: “We were the first disruptors in the Dutch market, like iBanFirst was in France and Belgium. 
Together with iBanFirst we are looking forward to taking the whole organisation to the next level with a state-of-the-art technology platform and a service-oriented sales force.
 Reducing costs of international payments and forex transactions via new Fintech offers, like XE.com, TransferWise, CurrencyTransfer.com, WorldFirst, iBanFirst, Ebury…​, but also via specialized software tools, like Kantox, FiREapps, Money Mover, Acumatica…​ 
French startup Ibanfirst is launching its full-fledged banking service for companies.
Ibanfirst plans to go much further than being a foreign exchange service.
The initial idea behind Ibanfirst is quite simple.
Ibanfirst provides better exchange rates and smaller fees so that you end up paying less to change money.
 So far, Ibanfirst has managed more than €1 billion in transactions across 100,000 transfers for 1,000 clients. 
Ibanfirst has a banking license in Belgium and can operate in the European Union.
Opening an Ibanfirst account is free.
Ibanfirst just wants to be more competitive than traditional banks with lower fees.
 Finally, Ibanfirst plans to add a wide array of services on top of these basic banking features — in particular, the startup plans to partner with other fintech companies. 
Ibanfirst already has an API so that you can integrate the company’s services with other services.
 In many ways, Ibanfirst’s approach reminds me of N26’s fintech platform approach.

 With the ‘Payment Tracker’, iBanFirst’s mid-cap and SME clients can trace payments the same way consumers can track parcels. 
 iBanFirst, a global financial services provider delivering solutions across banking borders, launched its ‘Payment Tracker' - a real-time payment-tracking service that sets new transparency standards for the payments industry. 
 With the ‘Payment Tracker', iBanFirst's mid-cap and SME clients can trace payments the same way consumers can track parcels. 
The ‘Payment Tracker' is a simple interface accessible on the iBanFirst platform or via an invitation email.
 Creating the ‘Payment Tracker' required the reconciliation of different types of payment status - SWIFT and iBanFirst - as well as giving secure access to this information outside the platform, in order for payment beneficiaries to use the service, not solely iBanFirst clients. 
 Commenting on the launch, Oualid Abderrazek, Chief Product Officer, iBanFirst said:   Until now, little had been done to provide real-time status updates on international bank transfers for both payers and payees. 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and Founder of iBanFirst, said:   We are delighted to launch the iBanFirst ‘Payment Tracker', which brings a time-honoured tracking experience from the parcel delivery industry to cross-border payments. 
 With the ‘Payment Tracker', iBanFirst remains true to its mission of empowering companies operating internationally. 
 After establishing itself in the Netherlands last month, iBanFirst, global financial services provider delivering solutions across banking borders, today announced the acquisition of Forexfix, a German foreign-exchange start-up based in Berlin with clients across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 
 As a result, Forexfix’s customers will benefit from iBanFirst’s award-winning online platform, a single interface to receive and make cross-border payments, hedge foreign exchange risks and finance their international growth. 
This takeover is instrumental in iBanFirst’s change of scale and contributes to the 5 billion euros in payments processed for its more than 3 000 clients this year.
 Apart from their belief that SMEs are underserved by traditional banks and overcharged on their foreign exchange transactions, Robert and Gerhard share with iBanFirst’s founders a drive to build outstanding financial services and user experience for businesses. 
 Robert Kröber, VP Sales and Head of Germany, iBanFirst, explained what the deal means for Forexfix’s customers: “Although very successful on the German-speaking market, Forexfix’s platform did not meet all needs, especially those of exporters receiving foreign currencies. 
This is where the iBanFirst platform comes into play as it offers a compelling solution for both importers and exporters.
 iBanFirst builds on the strength of its technology, personal service and Forexfix’s in-depth knowledge of the German-speaking market to further expand in Europe. 
 Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and founder of iBanFirst, commented: “We are pleased with this second acquisition this year, which not only expands our geographical footprint but also enhances our knowledge of the German-speaking market. 
This deal demonstrates iBanFirst’s ability to deliver relevant cross-border payment solutions for an ever-greater number of businesses throughout Europe and to scale up its operations in more and more countries.”
 Faced with volatile foreign exchange rates that can have an impact on profits, the Franco-Belgian platform iBanFirst allows SMEs to easily compare exchange rates and make transactions in 25 currencies. 
 The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Novo Nordisk's newest treatment for obesity, a weekly injection called Wegovy. 
 In diabetes, Novo's GLP-1s are likely to face new pressure soon from rival Eli Lilly, which has developed a weekly combination shot called tirzepatide that has outperformed Novo's weekly drug. 
 Novo is developing a similar drug, but it hasn't completed early stage trials. 
 Wegovy contains the same active ingredient as Novo's weekly diabetes shot Ozempic and its daily pill Rybelsus, a compound called semaglutide. 
 Novo and Lilly are by far the two biggest competitors in the GLP-1 space, but only Novo has tested its products as obesity-specific drugs in the absence of pre-existing diabetes. 
 This has added a small but growing revenue stream to Novo's sales outlook, while its flagship insulin franchise has been in retreat. 
 Moreover, Novo was among the companies that has come under heavy criticism for high insulin costs, and won't want to resuscitate any criticism over pricing. 
 In coming up with a response to tirzepatide, Novo has lagged behind. 
 However, Novo is closer to market with a novel diabetes product in its once-weekly insulin, which is in Phase 3 trials. 
 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a seal of approval to Wegovy (semaglutide), Novo Nordisk’s injectable treatment (2.4 mg once a week) intended for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or that are overweight, with at least one weight-related condition (i.e. high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol. 
 “Despite the best efforts to lose weight, many people with obesity struggle to achieve and maintain weight loss due to physiological responses that favor weight regain​,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo Nordisk. 
 After Novo Nordisk last week snagged its hotly anticipated obesity green light for semaglutide, the drugmaker is wasting no time kicking the launch into gear. 
 With its Wegovy approval in hand, the company is prepping for “one of the fastest Novo Nordisk launches after approval ever,” Camilla Sylvest, Novo’s head of commercial strategy and corporate affairs, said on a call with investors Monday. 
 Between now and then, Novo has lined up doctor events to spread the word, according to a company presentation released alongside the call. 
 Novo didn't release a price for the new drug, but the company said it plans to introduce Wegovy at a similar list price to its previously approved weight loss drug Saxenda. 
 With Wegovy, Novo is angling to more than double its obesity sales by 2025 versus its 2019 baseline, Chief Financial Officer Karsten Knudsen said on the call. 
RELATED: Novo Nordisk makes headway in bid to rule obesity market with stunning phase 3 semaglutide data
 Despite obesity's increasing prevalence in the U.S. and elsewhere, the disease is still widely under-treated: There are around 100 million people struggling with the condition in the U.S., but less than 3% currently receive anti-obesity medications, Novo said. 
 In late-stage testing, Wegovy helped patients achieve and sustain an average of 15% weight loss for 68 weeks, Novo said on the call. 
 Still, Novo has acknowledged that expanding its foothold in the obesity market will be no easy feat. 
 It’s not yet clear how Novo plans to target patients, but Sylvest said the company's strategies will be “very much patient-directed, much more than they have been in the diabetes space.   
Novo is also launching a $25 copay card in the U.S. for patients whose insurance covers anti-obesity medications.
 Looking ahead, Novo plans to pursue broader Medicare coverage in the long term, but its current focus hinges on commercial coverage, Sylvest said. 
 The drug is injected below the skin once a week and will come paired with its own single-dose delivery device, Novo revealed Monday. 
 Later this year, Novo aims to kick off a 1,000-subject phase 3a trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide 50 mg versus placebo in patients who are obese or overweight with comorbidities. 
 For treating men with de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), adding abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) and prednisone to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), according to results presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.1 
 The PEACE-1 study randomized men with de novo mCSPC in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to standard of care (SOC), SOC plus abiraterone acetate/prednisone, SOC plus radiotherapy (RT), or SOC plus abiraterone plus RT. 
 “In conclusion, adding abiraterone and prednisone to ADT plus docetaxel clearly improves radiographic PFS in men with de novo metastatic prostate cancer,” Fizazi said.

 Novo Nordisk pulled a highly anticipated win for its GLP-1 therapy semaglutide in obesity on Friday, becoming the first company to get a chronic weight management drug for adults past regulators since 2014. 
 The blockbuster generated $3.4 billion in sales last year, surpassing Novo’s older GLP-1 drug Victoza. 
 It’ll be marketed as Wegovy in obesity, and Novo expects to start rolling it out later this month.

 NOVO Acai Bowls opens Saturday, May 15, with a buy-one-get-one half off promotion for any who visit. 
 Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) has gained U.S. approval for a once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg injection, dubbed Wegovy, for chronic weight management. 
 The drug will be available to obese adults and certain overweight people and should be used in conjunction with diet and exercise, Novo Nordisk said in a statement. 
 Wegovy’s price will be similar to Saxenda, which is $1,349 a month, Novo spokesman Michael Bachner said. 
Novo Nordisk is back for round two with a new Ozempic dosing regimen.
 Novo's resubmission aims to nab an approval for a once-weekly, 2-mg dose for Ozempic, a GLP-1 drug already approved for weekly dosing at 0.5 mg and 1 mg. 
 The FDA specifically asked for more information about a potential new production site in Denmark, a Novo spokesperson told Fierce Pharma in March. 
The spokesperson said they didn't believe Novo would need to file any additional clinical data to score its Ozempic label extension.
RELATED: The top 20 pharma companies by 2020 revenue | 17. Novo Nordisk
 Novo first applied for the 2-mg Ozempic dose back in January, shortly after Lilly's Trulicity added 3-mg and 4.5-mg doses to its U.S. label. 
 The other drug likely on Novo's mind is Lilly's tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist that recently trumped Ozempic in a head-to-head trial. 
 RELATED: Novo Nordisk, after obesity trial win for injectable semaglutide, plans test for oral version 
The trial didn't compare tirzepatide to the 2-mg Ozempic dose Novo is now angling to get approved.
 Still, Novo is hoping its newly minted oral semaglutide option Rybelsus can help pick up the slack. 
Rybelsus also seems to be popular among patients who've never tried a GLP-1. Novo noted that group comprised more than 80% of its new scripts.
And Novo's got another GLP-1 ace up its sleeve.
 Ahead of that expected green light sometime in the second quarter, Novo has entered “full go mode” for its obesity launch, Doug Langa, executive vice president for North America, told Fierce Pharma in early May.

 LISBON, June 5 (Reuters) - Portugal’s Resolution Fund said it had injected another 317 million euros ($386 million) into Novo Banco, which emerged from the collapse of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) in 2014. 
 The new injection on Friday is contentious in Portugal as Novo Banco is 75% owned by U.S. private equity fund Lone Star and because the state-backed fund, which has the remaining 25%, has already provided 3 billion euros in capital since 2017. 
 Lone Star acquired the majority stake in Novo Banco in 2017, with the sale contract stipulating that the Resolution Fund must inject up to 3.9 billion euros in case of losses on the sale of some toxic assets inherited from BES. 
 On Monday, Novo Banco reported quarterly profit of 70.1 million euros and a jump of 12% in net interest income, after losses running into billions of euros since its rescue. 
 Nebraska-based Hillcrest Hospice, a subsidiary of Hillcrest Health Services, has moved into Western Iowa with a de novo location council bluffs. 
 Capital, also recently opened a de novo in the state. 
 Novo Resources has upped the ante at its Beatons Creek gold mine near Nullagine in WA’s Pilbara region, with the company’s Nullagine mill pushing out more than 5,000 ounces of gold in May with the recently recommissioned plant now nearing nameplate capacity. 
 Novo has attracted a group of team-oriented, practical, and resilient people that have put their collective shoulders to the wheel, negotiated challenging operational conditions, and extreme heat and rain events to continually drive the project forward. 
Novo is currently pioneering development of conglomerate-hosted gold mineralisation in WA’s Pilbara region and is Australia’s first modern producer of conglomerate gold.
Ore mined from the Beatons Creek deposits is trucked 14km south to the company’s Golden Eagle mill that was recently refurbished by Novo following its purchase of the mothballed operation from Millennium Minerals in 2020.
Novo has now more than likely silenced its critics as it showcases the economics of the Pilbara’s conglomerate gold deposits.
 LISBON, June 2 (Reuters) - Portugal’s Resolution Fund said it had agreed with a banking syndicate to borrow 475 million euros ($580.36 million) to shore up the capital of lender Novo Banco, which emerged from the ruins of the collapsed Banco Espirito Santo. 
 The loan is politically controversial as Novo Banco is 75% owned by U.S. private equity fund Lone Star and because the state-backed Resolution Fund, which has the remaining 25%, has injected 3 billion euros into the bank’s capital since 2017. 
 Lone Star acquired the majority stake in Novo Banco in 2017, with the sale contract stipulating that the Resolution Fund must inject up to 3.9 billion euros in case of losses on the sale of some toxic assets inherited from collapsed Banco Espirito Santo. 
 Chief Executive Antonio Ramalho told Reuters on Tuesday that Novo Banco, finally purged of the toxic legacy it inherited from the collapsed BES, is focusing on boosting profits to increase shareholder value. 
 LISBON, June 1 (Reuters) - Portugal’s Novo Banco, purged of the legacy of the collapsed Banco Espirito Santo (BES), is focusing on boosting profits to increase shareholder value, its chief executive said. 
 Now, our priority - what guides and inspires us - is to increase the value of Novo Banco’s profitability and generate capital (internally),” CEO Antonio Ramalho told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Ramalho dismissed speculation that Novo Banco could be caught up in an immediate wave of consolidation as “our banking system in Portugal is still at the stage of its reinvention”.
Novo Banco will always be available to analyse all options.
Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk has announced a new collaboration and licence agreement with Japan’s Heartseed to develop the company’s investigational cell therapy HS-001 for heart failure.

 However, Novo Nordisk has the rights to co-commercialise HS-001 with Heartseed in Japan, with equal profit and cost sharing. 
   We are delighted to have a company with the expertise and resources of Novo Nordisk as our partner for development and commercialisation of HS-001, and are also honoured that Novo Nordisk has recognised the innovativeness and high potential of our technology,   said Keiichi Fukuda, chief executive officer of Heartseed. 
   We believe that the partnership with Novo Nordisk is very valuable as we seek to disseminate our Japan-origin innovation globally as early as possible,” he added. 
 GHENT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confo Therapeutics today announced the establishment of its Medical Advisory Board (MAB). 
 The MAB will provide external review and strategic advice for the company’s clinical development program including the future direction of CFTX-1554, Confo’s lead pre-clinical candidate in neuropathic pain. 
 The international MAB members contribute comprehensive clinical and translational expertise with strong backgrounds in various aspects of neuropathic pain, Confo’s initial focus area. 
 Paolo Vicini, Chief Development Officer of Confo Therapeutics, commented, “Establishing a Medical Advisory Board is an important step for our evolving organization as we continue developing into a clinical stage R&D company. 
 Prof. Andrew Rice, Chair of Confo’s Medical Advisory Board added, “I am thrilled to chair Confo Therapeutics’ newly formed Medical Advisory Board as the company continues making strides toward developing compelling treatment options in an otherwise underserved indication. 
 “We are grateful to be working together with this powerhouse of globally recognized clinical scientists and pain specialists,” said Cedric Ververken, Chief Executive Officer of Confo Therapeutics. 
The members of Confo Therapeutics’ MAB are listed below.
Member biographies are also available on the Confo website.
 CFTX-1554 is Confo Therapeutics’ first product candidate in pre-clinical development and is designed to address peripheral neuropathic pain while avoiding centrally mediated side effects, such as addiction and sedation.

 Confo Therapeutics – Belgium-based Confo Therapeutics established a Medical Advisory Board that will be chaired by Andrew Rice, Professor of Pain Research at Imperial College London, United Kingdom. 
 GHENT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confo Therapeutics announced today that it has been awarded a EUR 1 million grant from Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship (VLAIO). 
 The grant will support the pre-clinical development of CFTX-1554, Confo’s lead candidate for neuropathic pain, which was initially discovered under a previous VLAIO research grant. 
 Confo is developing CFTX-1554 based on its promise as a potential treatment for patients living with peripheral neuropathic pain, a debilitating condition for which current treatment methods are ineffective or often result in severe side-effects or even addiction. 
 Paolo Vicini, CDO of Confo Therapeutics, commented: “The additional biomarker research we can now undertake has the potential to add significant value to our program by laying the groundwork needed to obtain proof of pharmacology data in Phase I. Furthermore, this newly secured funding will allow us to conduct the experimental evaluations needed to determine the optimal dose range for a Phase I clinical trial.” 
 Cedric Ververken, CEO of Confo Therapeutics, added: “With the support of the VLAIO grant we are well-positioned to rapidly advance CFTX-1554 towards a first-in-human Phase I trial.

 GHENT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confo Therapeutics today announced the selection of its first preclinical drug candidate, CFTX-1554, a compound designed to address peripheral neuropathic pain with the potential to address additional pain indications. 
 Confo has applied its proprietary, fragment-based drug discovery and structure-guided drug design technologies to identify CFTX-1554, a novel inhibitor of angiotensin II type 2 receptor, or AT2R, a clinically validated target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. 
 As the Company’s first discovery program ready to enter preclinical evaluation, the selection of CFTX-1554 marks the achievement of a significant corporate milestone in the development of Confo’s internal pipeline. 
Confo believes that this previously unexplored binding site interaction holds the potential for its lead compound to be both safe and efficacious in a disease area with severely limited treatment options.
 By leveraging our rational drug design and small molecule expertise to identify and create CFTX-1554, we believe this novel chemical entity could better and more safely inhibit AT2R as a validated target in neuropathic pain,” said Christel Menet, CSO of Confo Therapeutics. 
 Commenting on the selection, Paolo Vicini, CDO of Confo Therapeutics added: “Peripheral neuropathic pain can manifest as a result of a variety of conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. 
 Confo aims to address this indication with CFTX-1554, a novel inhibitor of angiotensin II type 2 receptor, or AT2R, which has the potential to be safer, more tolerable and result in fewer side effects.

 GHENT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confo Therapeutics, a pioneering biopharma company, today announces that it has been granted two key ConfoBodyTM patents derived from the patent estate known as the “Steyaert patents”. 
 The Steyaert patents – named after Prof. Jan Steyaert (VIB-VUB), their first-named inventor and scientific founder of Confo Therapeutics – are a series of patents and patent applications that cover the composition-of-matter and various uses of ConfoBodies (single-domain antibodies capable of binding specific protein conformations) in structural biology and drug discovery. 
Confo Therapeutics holds the exclusive commercial rights to the Steyaert patent estate in the field of GPCR structure determination and drug discovery.
Confo Therapeutics has now obtained a further European patent and a further US patent within the Steyaert patents.
 The European patent (EP 2 593 792, granted on 13 November 2019) covers composition-of-matter claims for a number of ConfoBodies. 
 This includes the ConfoBody known as “Nb80”, which was generated by Prof. Steyaert and subsequently used by Prof. Brian Kobilka and co-workers at Stanford University to generate the first structure of an active-state G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) conformation. 
 The US patent (US 10,436,796, granted on 8 October 2019) covers methods for generating and producing ConfoBodies, independent of their origin, target or sequence. 
 Other granted patents and pending applications within the Steyaert patents cover GPCR-ConfoBody complexes, GPCR screening methods in which a ConfoBody is used to keep the GPCR in an active conformation, G s -stabilizing ConfoBodies, and host cells that are capable of expressing both a ConfoBody and a GPCR. 
 In addition to the Steyaert patents, Confo Therapeutics also holds an exclusive license for GPCRs to the MegabodyTM technology and associated patent application(s) from VIB-VUB. 
 Confo Therapeutics is a pioneering biopharmaceutical company building a portfolio of transformative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases using its proprietary Confo® technology, a proprietary GPCR conformation-sensitive drug discovery engine. 
Confo Therapeutics’ unique approach presents G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the conformation of interest.
 This increases screening sensitivity and enables the determination of the 3D structure of the relevant conformation, allowing for the identification of novel chemical starting points and the rational design of new medicines with optimal properties. 
 As well as developing its own pipeline, Confo Therapeutics has secured revenue-generating drug discovery partnerships with select leading pharma companies. 
 Confo Therapeutics was spun out of Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) in 2015 and has since raised over €36.7 million from an international investor syndicate (BioGeneration Ventures, Capricorn Partners, Fund+, MINTS, Perceptive Advisors, PMV, QBIC, V-Bio Ventures, VIB and Wellington Partners).

 GHENT, Belgium, and DRESDEN, Germany, July 03, 2019 / B3C newswire / -- Confo Therapeutics, an emerging drug discovery company, and DyNAbind GmbH today announce a drug discovery collaboration on an undisclosed G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). 
The collaboration will combine ConfoBody™-enabled GPCRs with DyNAbind’s Dynamic DNA-encoded Library for the discovery of small molecule GPCR-modulating compounds.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Confo Therapeutics will gain exclusive, worldwide rights to any drug candidates arising from the collaboration and will be responsible for their development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 Commenting on the deal, Dr Christel Menet, Confo Therapeutics’ CSO, said: “This collaboration will leverage the combination of two cutting-edge technologies to expand our universe of hits on a GPCR previously thought to be intractable. 
Confo Therapeutics’ technology has proven itself to be a powerful tool for the stabilization of GPCRs in a particular conformation.
Confo Therapeutics is building a portfolio of first-in-class programs based on its proprietary Confo® technology which makes use of antibody fragments or “ConfoBodies™” to stabilize G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in a particular conformation of interest as a superior starting point for drug discovery.
 In addition to developing its own pipeline, Confo Therapeutics is entering into revenue-generating drug discovery partnerships with select pharma companies, on GPCR targets which do not compete with its internal projects. 
 Confo Therapeutics was spun out of Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB in 2015 and has since raised over €36.7 million from an international investor syndicate (BioGeneration Ventures, Capricorn Venture Partners, Fund+, MINTS, Perceptive Advisors, PMV, QBIC, V-Bio Ventures, VIB and Wellington Partners). 
Confo Therapeutics has raised €30 million ($34 million) to take compounds targeting difficult-to-drug GPCRs into clinical development.
The series A round (PDF) sets Confo up to advance drugs derived from a novel way of stabilizing GPCRs and performing more sensitive screens.
Belgium-based Confo is built on a platform that uses single-domain antibody fragments like Ablynx’s Nanobodies to stabilize GPCRs in specific conformations.
 Stabilizing GPCRs enables Confo to screen for agonist activity against the targets, resulting in a platform it thinks is more efficient and sensitive than high-throughput screening and other forms of fragment-based drug discovery. 
 Researchers at the University of Brussels and Stanford University identified the potential of the approach, leading to the foundation of Confo. 
 Since then, Confo has worked to industrialize the drug discovery platform—increasing throughput—and landed validatory deals with Lundbeck and Roche. 
 Now, Confo has raised €30 million to advance candidates discovered using its portfolio of screening tools, such as radioligand competition. 
 Confo has programs against three targets in its pipeline, the most advanced of which recently came through its first in vivo study. 
 The series A round will enable Confo to advance the lead program and two others, which are at the hit-to-lead stage. 
 It should get our lead program to phase 1 … and then also continue to feed the pipeline to deliver clinical candidates going forward,” Confo CEO Cedric Ververken said. 
 Fund+ and Perceptive Advisors put money into Confo for the first time, while Capricorn Health-Tech Fund, Qbic, Participatie Maatschappij Vlaanderen, MINTS, V-Bio Ventures and VIB returned having previously helped the biotech get started with seed funding. 
The investors’ interest in Confo is testament to both the potential of the biotech’s platform to find new ways to drug a key class of targets and the track record of the team overseeing the effort.
 The CEO is flanked in the Confo management team by Christel Menet, who was involved in the discovery of filgotinib at Galapagos, and fellow Ablynx veteran Toon Laeremans. 
 GHENT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confo Therapeutics, an emerging drug discovery company, today announces that it has entered into an agreement with VIB, a life sciences research institute in Flanders, Belgium, for an exclusive, worldwide license to VIB’s ‘Megabody’ technology. 
 The Megabody technology enabled an international team of scientists, including Confo Therapeutics’ founder, Prof Jan Steyaert of the VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology, to produce high resolution cryo-EM structures of the native human GABA A receptor in complex with common drugs for the first time - published in this week’s Nature, see full references below. 
 Under the license agreement, Confo Therapeutics will apply the Megabody technology to its proprietary Confo® bodies to further improve their use in 3D structure determination of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 
 The Megabody scaffold adds more mass and structural features to Confobodies, while retaining their ability to stabilize GPCRs in the particular conformation of interest for drug discovery. 
 Commenting on the deal, Dr Cedric Ververken, Confo Therapeutics’ CEO, said: “The Megabody technology will be a valuable addition to our Confo technology and gives us an outstanding toolbox for GPCR structure-based drug discovery. 
We congratulate Jan for the success of this novel technology and are grateful to VIB for entrusting its use to Confo Therapeutics.”
 The unprecedented quality of the cryo-EM structure of the GABA A receptor, made possible by using the Megabody technology, revealed the receptor in its proper pentameric conformation for the first time, while also providing new information on the binding sites and mode of action of high value drugs including alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium).

The BNY chose Proxyclick’s cloud-based visitor management system because:
BNY tenants now can pre-register their visitors in Proxyclick’s platform so those visitors can scan the QR code from their invitation email at the BNY’s entrances.
 Many other security features, such as the use of Proxyclick’s watchlists, work behind the scenes to help security staff flag visitors needing additional screening. 
 The watchlist is automatically updated in Proxyclick, so it’s consistent across all seven of their gates. 
 If someone not on the watchlist tries to enter, Proxyclick automatically notifies the entire BNY security team via text message, in real time. 
 Proxyclick’s integration with S2 also notifies the BNY’s hosts of their visitor’s arrival, keeping everyone in the loop. 
 Now more than a year into deployment, Proxyclick manages visitor access for all the BNY’s shuttle buses, drive-through gates and pedestrian scanners. 
 Cecere indicated that BNY shifted to using Proxyclick almost exclusively for new tenants, which helped reduce risk of virus exposure to security staff. 
 Pre-registration of visitors at the BNY is now up more than 30%, and the tenants are happy with the benefits of Proxyclick at their buildings. 
Proxyclick is poised to continue helping them find ways to improve visitor experience and security in the long term.
 “Today we are testing an integration between Proxyclick, the access-control system and an automated license plate scanner to help solve an ongoing issue with deliveries,” Cecere said. 
 This allows them to use Proxyclick at their buildings with their own specific workflows and visitor experience, all while connecting to the BNY’s access control system to provide the same consistent arrival experience. 
 With Proxyclick orchestrating access, assisting with directions, loading authorized number plates, notifying security if needed and doing it all in real time, the future looks bright in Brooklyn. 
The BNY has shifted to Proxyclick exclusively for new tenants/new staff/volunteers for tenants.
 “Proxyclick has been super helpful; I’m not sure what we would have done otherwise if we didn’t have a system that was convenient and easy to use,” said Cecere. 
Proxyclick also proved to be an immediate advantage in the Yard’s on-premises management of the COVID-19 virus outbreak.
 “If visitors use local entrance lanes, security officers at guard booths will type into Proxyclick kiosks for guests.

 Twikit unveiled its latest cloud suite product, Laddy. 
Twikit’s vision for Laddy is to use the power of AI to transform unique user input into individualized lattices with guaranteed mechanical properties.
 With Laddy, Twikit will facilitate an efficient on-demand manufacturing process for the individualization of lattices. 
 Mass customization software firm Twikit has a number of products that mass customize anything from jewelry to orthotics, car parts and sports gear. 
Twikit’s new solution deals with both of these issues by letting you easily mass customize lattice shapes.
 At the same time, it adds to Twikit’s arsenal a broader category of tools that could take the company deeper into the engineer’s toolbox. 
I’m a huge Twikit fan and this is just a great product that expands the makeable for everyone.
Twikit is a mass customization startup that hopes to make many things parametric.
Martijn gives us an idea of what is going in their market and how Twikit works.
 If the company would acquire or partner with Twikit, or a similar firm, then they could offer end-to-end, materials-to-mass-customization as a service. 
Martijn Joris is the CEO of Twikit NV.
 Founded in 2012, Twikit is an Antwerp-based start-up. 
Twikit aims to “guide companies into 3D customization and digital manufacturing.”
 In addition to their customization software, Twikit also offer consultancy and design services. 
 3D printing the next 5 years by Martijn Joris, CEO Twikit NV 
At the end of 2012 I co-founded Twikit.
 At Twikit, we strongly believe in the great impact the technology will have in the next 5 years, enabling more customization and design freedom. 
The 3D trophy factory was the first end-to-end application built by Twikit.
More information about Twikit is available here.
Twikit is a Belgium based startup that makes mass customization software.
 By letting a person customize something, ensuring that this can be visualized in the browser and then also actually be a file that can be manufactured by Twikit ties unique inputs to makable things. 
Twikit’s software takes the potential of 3D printing to make unique things and turns it into something that many can use (within limits).
Twikit has just released its Twikbot software platform for Prosthetics and Orthotics.
Now Twikit can not only be used for customized car parts or parts of consumer electronics but also for medical applications.
We interviewed Twikit’s CTO Olivier De Deken about a new development that the firm has just released.
What does Twikit do for orthotics & prosthetics?
 Additionally, Twikit provides design engineering and integration services to implement the technology. 
 The company is the first to take automotive personalization to this level, and it’s doing so with the help of Twikit, a Belgian company whose software platform emphasizes 3D printed customization possibilities. 
 “Twikit technology was a bull’s eye right from the start,” said Twikit Co-Founder Gijs Hoppenbrouwers. 
 Twikit was founded in 2012 by Hoppenbrouwers, Martijn Joris and George Lieben. 
 Besides working with BMW, Twikit also offers its personalized production services for prosthetics and orthotics, jewelry, electronics, windows and doors, and more. 
 MINI, a British automaker owned by BMW, has integrated the customization software of Twikit, a Belgian personalization software provider. 
 Twikit’s goal is the provision of bespoke end-use products for the masses through advanced manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC. 
 Gijs Hoppenbrouwers, a co-founder of Twikit, said, “Customization for a mass audience is also perfectly possible for jewelry, furniture, windows and doors, electronics.” 
 To give the buyers full control over design, MINI has integrated Twikit’s Twikbot platform, a browser-based design, and production workflow. 
 Twikit: Capture the value of on-demand digitally manufactured, personalized products 
 Twikit is a B2B software company in the space of digital manufacturing, enabling brands to tap into the value of product individualization at scale. 
 Twikit, on the other hand, has a configuration engine that is parametric and could be used for all of these types of operations. 
 With excellent UX and usability for consumers, the Twikit tool could be a customer-friendly face for mass customization. 
Because Twikit was designed for 3D printing it would also let them enter our market.
 Moreover, Twikit is optimized to work with software such as what SAP and Fujitsu have in order to ensure that the right product gets made the right way. 
 DMS is also partnering with Twikit, a Belgian 3D software firm specializing in customization, to drive innovation in the AM industry as well as adoption. 
 DSM and Twikit have already started their cooperative effort, working to develop an end-to-end production workflow for customizable 3D printed orthotics and prosthetics. 
 In the automotive sector, DSM and Twikit will focus on customizable features for vehicles, such as dashboards, light covers, car seats and more. 
“Our partnership with Twikit allows us to make significant advances in key sectors that stand to benefit from the wider-scale adoption of additive manufacturing.
 “Reinforcing our 3D printing ecosystem with experienced partners like Twikit enables us to offer customers not just materials, but also expertise and insights to translate market needs into total 3D printed solutions. 
 Orthobroker, a Belgian-based specialist with more than 10 years of experience in the development and sales of orthopedic devices, is launching the OrthoSOLID® platform in collaboration with Twikit. 
The cloud-based software solution from Twikit which enables distributed end-to-end workflows for made-to-fit orthopedic products and wearables.
 Until January 2021, MINI owners were able to design and order various personalized parts thanks to Twikit’s proprietary design software, but MINI scrapped the service with very little explanation earlier this year. 
 Working with Belgian personalization software provider Twikit for instance, BMW has provided a mass customization service for its subsidiary car company MINI. 
 DSM additionally selected and helped startups to develop tools for the 3D printing industry, worked with Twikit on mass customization, introduced custom mouth guards to market, all while it invested in numerous 3D printing businesses, including Addaptive3D. 
 If entering this market as a start-up, the lowest cost and perhaps even the most interesting path would be to combine a mass customization technology, such as Twikit, with a service and some software to create mass-customized products. 
 The 3D printed trophy, which we’re slightly more interested in than the results of the competition, was created by 3DTrophyFactory, the custom trophy arm of Belgian digital manufacturing and 3D customization company Twikit. 
 The award, now probably exhibited in GuiFera’s home somewhere in Brazil, took quite a bit of careful planning to realize, as Twikit says it had to be printed perfectly on the first run. 
 Twikit 3D printed the trophy parts using stereolithography (SLA), a 3D printing method that uses a photopolymerization process to harden layers of resin until an object is built up. 
 Once the parts were 3D printed out of photopolymer resins, the Twikit team set to work removing supports, post-processing the parts, assembling them, and finally hand-painting the trophy. 
MINI also integrated Belgian personalization software provider Twikit’s customization software to provide mass customization services using 3D printing.
 The company has also partnered with Twikit, a Belgian personalization software provider, to co-develop new 3D printed solutions for medical, automotive, and apparel applications. 
 This edition of 3D Printing Industry’s Sliced news digest features the latest stories from: Markforged, Airbus, Adafruit, SLM Solutions, RMIT, Urquhart Opticians, PES and Twikit. 
The trophy was SLA 3D printed in resin by the 3D Trophy Factory at Belgium’s Twikit NV.
 It would be easy for NISMO to work with Twikit, for example, to offer customization through the same program; e.g., by getting your name on the aftermarket part or customizing a nob with a design or particular texture. 
 In November 2018, MINI, a British automaker owned by BMW, integrated the customization software of Twikit, a Belgian personalization software provider. 
 In November, we also reported the Twikit-enabled BMW MINI customization platform. 
Here 3D printing will provide unique cases which could be customized using software such as Twikit’s.
 Next to present in the competition was Belgium-based startup Twikit, which makes mass customization software and just launched its Twikbot platform for the orthotics and prosthetics market. 
 Twikit has a fast-growing, global team of 33 employees, and is currently closing a Series A funding round.

Cowboy Camaraderie: Rodeo returns to Las Vegas with two organizations teaming up for a three-day weekend
 There actually are Black cowboys and cowgirls,’ ” Howard-Cunningham says. 
 “They’ve been doing great things in supporting Black cowboys and the sport of rodeo, and we thought we were in position to help them take what they’ve been doing to a new level,” PBR CEO Sean Gleason says. 
 “If you look back at the history of cowboys, it was the first true melting pot of American society. 
 It was white settlers moving to the West, Black free men moving to the West and all them learning the craft and trade of the true cowboy out to the railheads, and learning from the Hispanic vaqueros. 
 “The reason BPIR was created was because the Black cowboys and cowgirls were excluded from other rodeo circuits and not embraced, so it’s always been the vision to teach and educate the community about the history,” Howard-Cunningham says. 
“We want to elevate Black cowboys and cowgirls to the same level as everyone else.”
 Though the Lone Star spotlight has shone on Dak Prescott﻿'s recovery from a season-ending ankle injury, one of the Dallas Cowboys quarterback's standout receivers has been dealing with an ankle ailment of his own. 
 Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper may not be ready for the start of training camp due to an ankle injury, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday. 
 Since being traded to the Cowboys by the Raiders in the midst of the 2018 season, Cooper has been a focal point for the Dallas offense. 
Marcus Spears examines the Cowboys' questions on defense and says he believes the team needs to make the playoffs to have a successful season.
He is the second longest tenured Dallas Cowboys defender.
He has played only 38 games since the Cowboys drafted him as a second-round pick in 2015.
 And, for the first time since 2015, Gregory is taking part in the Cowboys' offseason program. 
   I want to get away from that past,   Gregory said Tuesday after the first day of the Cowboys' mandatory minicamp. 
 Defensive end Randy Gregory, 28, played in 10 games last season for the Cowboys and aims to make this season even stronger given he will have a full offseason to prepare. 
 The questions asked included how his participation in the offseason program will help, his role on the defense last season and what might change for 2021, his frustration at his lack of playing time, his size and thoughts on Cowboys coordinator Dan Quinn. 
   It's kind of funny, I was talking to my dad the other day, and he's a geek when it comes to football and Cowboys and me and especially when it comes to me,   Gregory said. 
 The Cowboys got a first-round talent in the second round and hoped he would be their next DeMarcus Ware, even giving him the No. 94 jersey. 
Ware had more than 10.5 sacks in seven of his nine seasons with the Cowboys.

   When I look at Randy's personal evaluation, I gave him two arrows pointing up,   Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said, recalling Gregory was reinstated to play beginning in Week 7 last season and the team wanted to be sure he was fully ready. 
 The Cowboys coordinator, who was the Atlanta Falcons coach at the time, worked Gregory out at Nebraska prior to the 2015 draft. 
 Randy Gregory, who had 3.5 sacks last season for the Cowboys, has renewed confidence in his abilities:   I've done a great job the last few years with the team on and off the field, and I'm looking forward to the future.   
The Cowboys stood by him when other teams might have parted ways with a player.

 What's written on it is a little more difficult to see, but it evokes a memory of Dallas Cowboys past beyond Lamb's No. 88. 
 Former Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens was electrifying, if at times a bit petulant. 
And they were high as a rookie in 2020 when he was surprisingly available to the Cowboys with the No. 17 overall draft pick.
No Cowboys rookie wide receiver has had as many catches in a season.
 Only Pro Football Hall of Famer Bob Hayes had more yards as a Cowboys rookie (1,003 in 1965) than Lamb. 
 Former Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens throws popcorn in his face after scoring a touchdown against Green Bay on Nov. 29, 2007. 
Which is why Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy believes the axiom of a player making his biggest jump from his rookie season to his second year rings true for Lamb.
 He accepted the responsibility of wearing the No. 88 jersey that had previously been worn by great Cowboy receivers Drew Pearson, Michael Irvin, and Dez Bryant, and Lamb's 935 receiving yards was nearly 400 more than what Bryant recorded his rookie season (Bryant played four less games his rookie season). 
 And while Lamb says he personally doesn't like to do a lot of talking, on his wrist when he made the sideline grab over Anthony Brown was a little homage to a different, much chattier, wide receiver of Cowboys' past. 
Then he said something that doesn't quite seem possible to anyone who watched Lamb at Oklahoma University or in his rookie season with the Cowboys.
 After all, he's the very same guy who openly admitted to modeling his football career after Dallas Cowboys legend Travis Frederick -- including both having made their way to the NFL by way of illustrious careers at the University of Wisconsin. 
 Perennially one of the best centers in all of football and a stellar human being to boot -- see his   Blocking Hunger Foundation   for additional evidence of the latter -- the loss of Frederick left a gargantuan void in the middle of the Cowboys offensive line, and they struck a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles (it appears that's becoming a draft day thing) to move up and take Biadasz in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft with the hopes of filling it.

 KC Davis, who goes by domesticblisters on TikTok, was “at [her] wit’s end being quarantined with two small children” when she saw the ad for Loop earplugs on Facebook—specifically, their ad saying, “Turn down the noise, not the love.” 
 Now that I've been sleeping with these Loop earplugs every night for more than two weeks, I can't imagine not sleeping with them. 
 The Loop earplugs are unbelievably lightweight, and I love that the little circles looks like jewelry (not foam). 
 Our pick Loop Earplugs Good fit and comfort Although no universal earplug will reduce different sounds as evenly as a custom design, the Loop pair offers solid noise protection and is the most enjoyable to wear. 
 Compared with cheap foam earplugs, which are designed to block all sounds, a good pair of universal-fit (aka musician-style) earplugs like the Loop Earplugs will provide a light-years-better listening experience, allowing you to hear music and voices at a safer level. 
 The Loop earplugs provide solid protection, will stay in place through dance moves and workouts, and have a discreet design that doesn’t protrude from your ear. 
 If you’re just looking for sound reduction, Loop Earplugs can be a cheaper alternative. 
 At CES 2019 we got a chance to check out the Loop earplugs that look cool, have a unique design to dampen sound, and which may become popular by people that don’t like traditional earplugs. 
 When that day arrives, make sure you’re prepared to protect yourself with the Loop Earplugs. 
 Loop earplugs come in five original colors: Glorious Gold, Flirty Rose Gold, Midnight Black, Raving Red and Swinging Silver. 
Loop earplugs are available now at eu.loopearplugs.com and internationally on loopearplugs.com for €29.95/$29.95.
 Loop earplugs are different than any others you’ve seen – they’re cylindrical and hollow, and allow sound waves to enter via a small opening and pass through an acoustic channel, enabling music and speech to remain clear while still protecting the eardrum. 
 Loop earplugs don’t distort or block sound, they just turn down the volume. 
 Loop earplugs are easy to insert and remove, and they stay put even if you’re moshing. 
Loop earplugs are available from the company’s website or from Amazon.
 By combining an acoustic channel and filter for natural sound in eight hot colors, Loop earplugs let wearers avoid hearing loss without looking like a dork. 
 Another option: Loop Earplugs, which work similarly to noise-isolating earbuds while adding a pretty snazzy out-facing, well, loop. 
 Normally a pair will run you $30, but for a limited time, Cheapskate readers can get Loop Earplugs for $22.47 shipped.

What did the Intuo platform data unveil?
The findings from the Intuo platform would indicate that those using it for a hybrid performance model get better results.
 However, while Intuo gave the number of data points it did not reveal more details about the data set. 
 Intuo also looked at the key drivers for employee engagement, finding three: 
 Tim Clauwaert, CEO of Intuo, commented: “Employee engagement taking business priority in 2020 comes as no surprise. 
It might have been even more interesting if Intuo had identified the negative drivers to employee engagement.
 The sample size was low and also was restricted to the Intuo Network, though it is unclear whether this means customers. 
The findings from the Intuo platform is more interesting but limited in scope.
 The company also acquired Intuo, a performance management solution that compliments the core HR offering of Unit4. 
Investment in Intuo continues and it recently launched research around the trend towards in hybrid performance management.
Intuo has also added new brands in the quarter.
The first to do so was Unit4 when it acquired Intuo early in 2019.
 Searle and Taylor features a wide range of kitchen styles, from signature and hand-made bespoke designs to contemporary kitchens by Austrian brands Intuo and EWE. 
 Unit4 uses its own Intuo employee engagement tool to do that internally, and is now offering customers and prospects a free 6-month subscription to do the same, says Ettling. 
It also acquired Employee experience firm Intuo.
 Intuo is a Ghent-based HR online talent platform that hopes to encourage ‘coaching culture’ within companies, recognise talent in employees and ‘future-proof’ organisations. 
Intuo translates a company’s mission into agile objectives with the hopes of making them more human-centric and ensuring that everyone’s available talents are being utilised in a way that maximises the value of each employee.
 The appointment comes six months after Unit4 acquired Intuo, a talent enablement and engagement solution, in a move that both broadened and deepened Unit4’s human capital management software proposition. 
 Ettling joins Unit4 just after it invested in Intuo, a startup in the HCM market that Ettling is very familiar with. 
 Prevero in CPM, Assistance PSA, and, most recently intuo for modern talent enablement, were the main catches. 
 Nobia develops and sells kitchens through some twenty strong brands in Europe, including Magnet in the UK; HTH, Norema, Sigdal, Invita and Marbodal in Scandinavia; Petra and A la Carte in Finland; ewe, FM and Intuo in Austria, as well as Poggenpohl globally. 
He cited the recent acquisition of cloud-native talent management vendor Intuo as an example of the type of company that is attractive:
 So Intuo, even though it's a smaller company, it looks like what I wanted, it's a cloud company with cloud DNA and cloud tools and cloud infrastructure. 
 The team at Unit4 have done what appears to be an admirable job of remaking the core ERP system as a modern, extensible, cloud-native platform, and recent acquisitions such as Intuo have certainly strengthened the offering.

 According to the founder of artificial intelligence outfit ScriptBook, Sony Pictures could have saved a fortune from 2015 to 2017 by using the company’s algorithms instead of human beings to reject or greenlight movies. 
 Film Festival, ScriptBook founder Nadira Azermai said that by analyzing screenplays, ScriptBook retroactively identified as box-office failures 22 out of the 32 Sony movies that lost money in that period, during which Sony released a total of 62 movies. 
 Many see in ScriptBook and similar AI systems the potential to destroy a major part of the film production and distribution ecosystem, displacing script readers and saving much of the money studios spend on test screenings, focus groups and market research. 
 At its most basic, ScriptBook, founded in 2015 and based in Antwerp, Belgium, has created a tool that analyzes the text of screenplays to produce financial forecasting, or as Azermai grandly puts it, “Our mission is to revolutionize the business of storytelling by using AI to help producers, distributors, sales agents and financiers assess their risk.” 
In 2016 ScriptBook raised $1.4 million in venture capital to accelerate development.
The system works like this: ScriptBook users upload a PDF file of a screenplay into the system.
 said Michiel Ruelens, data scientist at Scriptbook. 
 ScriptBook’s software has been “trained” on a large dataset of 6,500 existing scripts, said Ruelens. 
 Distributors will also find added value in ScriptBook, Ruelens added. 
 ScriptBook says that when its system indicates a script should be greenlit, it has an 84% success rate. 
 And in the MeToo age, said Ruelens, ScriptBook can help improve gender parity in movies. 
 When asked to retroactively assess the box office potential of “La La Land,” ScriptBook “predicted” the film would gross $59 million, whereas in fact it did more than $100 million in business (the difference could be attributed to the movie’s multiple Oscar nominations and wins, of course). 
“ScriptBook’s AI will just kick out movies that follow certain formulas.
 ScriptBook charges about $5,000 to ingest the script and generate a report on a single film, but offers discounts for companies that want to evaluate multiple projects. 
 The startup that does this is called Scriptbook and it automatically reads and scores scripts, offering Hollywood fat cats the ability to choose winners over flops. 
 then you may be about to get your wish, courtesy of a new automated script picker startup named ScriptBook and its Script2Screen software. 
 “The Script2Screen solution is an AI-based assessment that indicates the commercial and critical success [of a project], along with insights on the storyline, target demographics, market positioning, distribution parameters [and more] prior to any made costs,” ScriptBook CEO Nadira Azermai told Digital Trends. 
 To that end, ScriptBook’s work focuses more on “turkey shooting” by singling out the scripts which absolutely shouldn’t make it into production. 
 Since major studios have been brought down by misplaced faith in certain movie flops, ScriptBook could serve a valuable role in this capacity. 
Studios that work with ScriptBook can submit scripts online.
 At present, Azermai said that ScriptBook is being put through its paces by a number of entertainment companies in the U.S. and Europe, although “due to non-disclosure agreements we cannot share this information.” 
 While it’s not the only company to be exploring this potentially lucrative area (a similar startup named Epagogix in the U.K. was profiled by none other than Malcolm Gladwell a few years back), it’s definitely intriguing to hear about what ScriptBook is up to. 
 Belgium’s ScriptBook, founded in 2015, says its algorithms can predict a movie’s success just by analyzing its script. 
Grid View Sample analysis of 2017 comedy The Big Sick by Scriptbook’s software analyzes everything from characters’ “likeability” to box office revenue.
 But ScriptBook did share forecasts it made for movies released in 2017 and 2018, which suggest the company’s algorithms are doing a pretty good job. 
 ScriptBook’s algorithms, by comparison, correctly guessed whether a film would make money 86 percent of the time. 
 “So that’s twice the accuracy rate of what the industry achieved,” ScriptBook data scientist Michiel Ruelens tells The Verge. 
There are similar stories in ScriptBook’s predictions for 2017 / 2018 movies.
 ScriptBook said the film would make just $10 million, but it instead took in $21 million — a modest profit on a $10 million film. 
ScriptBook’s Ruelens suggests one un-Hollywood characteristic might be to blame: bashfulness.
 Ruelens says ScriptBook’s customers include some of the “biggest Hollywood studios,” but nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) prevent him from naming any. 
 Other new companies have also entered the AI game in the past few years, including Belgium-based ScriptBook and Israel’s Vault AI. 
 ScriptBook’s AI primarily analyses scripts, as opposed to actors or directors. 
 Within six minutes, ScriptBook’s AI reads a script and assigns it more than 400 parameters. 
 ScriptBook’s success rates are comparable to those of Cinelytic: 83% to 86%, Azermai claims, whereas human decision-making is successful 27% to 31% of the time. 
 Azermai is not yet at liberty to reveal which companies ScriptBook has been working with, but she applauds Warners’ announcement that it is working with Cinelytic. 
 As well as analytical tools, ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI, which it has given the dystopian sci-fi thriller name of Deepstory. 
 The ScriptBook program, which is expected to make its debut sometime next year, wants to be the best friend to movie studios and producers, helping them determine whether or not a movie is hit before they commit to actually making it. 
 Speaking with CNBC, ScriptBook CEO Nadira Azermai explained that this program will know the elements that make up any great story and will award screenplays high marks if it hits the right beats: 
 He also said that ScriptBook will be a vital tool for movie studios, whose old-fashioned method of actually hiring real human being to read screenplays and formulate their own honest gut reactions to other people’s work just isn’t cutting it anymore: 
ScriptBook may be able to read screenplays at the speed of light.
 We’re living in an era where we carry around tiny computers in our pockets, so yeah, ScriptBook probably works. 
 Azermai claims that ScriptBook will also provide users with a “creativity measure” that will examine aspects beyond the plot, which just sounds like total insanity. 
 Although Azermai says that ScriptBook is being tested with four major studios, it’s hard to imagine this actually catching on. 
 Simply by uploading the PDF of a script, Scriptbook.io can provide a detailed analysis on characters, detecting the protagonists and antagonists etc., within minutes. 
The scriptbook is available to pre-order in most major book stores (here for Barnes and Noble) and will be released on July 31st (Harry Potter / J.K.
At a point in time he handed over the scriptbook to Lyca and asked them to look for another director who could direct the film on a minimum budget.
8. It's Okay To Not Be Okay Scriptbook
 DC Comics writer Steve Orlando may be known for his work on Justice League of America, Supergirl and Midnighter, but at this year’s Flamecon in New York City he’ll be debuting something a tad different: an original scriptbook for The Liberator . You’ve never heard of The Liberator before, and that’s on purpose. 
 The Liberator features an original story that hasn’t already been published as a comic, and Olrando is having it professionally printed and bound in a scriptbook. 
So began ScriptBook’s phase two: automated story generation.
ScriptBook isn’t the only company making strides in the field.
 Belgium’s ScriptBook provides a similar service, touted as “artificially intelligent script analysis and box office forecasting”. 
 In practice, services like Cinelytic and ScriptBook work by mining and analyzing keywords attributable to a film’s themes, dialogue, and actors, with some also offering to analyse the scripts themselves. 
 It is arguable that many classic films could have been flagged as likely ‘failures’ by the likes of Cinelytic and Scriptbook, and therefore refused the proverbial green light in their day. 
Scriptbook’s website exclaims that its platform is progressing towards “co-creation between man and machine [in] the era of AI as a co-writer”.
 Companies like ScriptBook, which took in $1.2 million in Seed funding last year, are using AI to predict how well a movie will do at the box office just based on reading the screenplay. 
 ScriptBook’s AI platform binged on 4,000 scripts and 10,000 movies during the first six months, according to an article on Ubergizmo. 
 In one case, ScriptBook’s technology (called Script2Screen) analyzed the script for the sci-fi movie Passengers, a film about two people on the longest road trip ever. 
 That's a real possibility, according to a company called ScriptBook. 
 At a presentation at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, ScriptBook founder Nadira Azermai announced that her system correctly identified 22 out of 32 of Sony's box-office flops after analyzing screenplays of their films from 2015 to 2017. 
 But, Azermai claims that ScriptBook wouldn't crush creativity:   ScriptBook’s AI will just kick out movies that follow certain formulas. 
 And while its founder touts ScriptBook's ability to analyze gender equality in scripts, would AI have a built-in tendency to favor scripts about, say, robots taking over the world? 
 Developed in Belgium over several years, ScriptBook’s tag line is ‘hard science, better box office’. 
 ScriptBook’s data scientists input scripts from thousands of fi lms into a database, creating a reservoir of information against which they can plot new scripts. 
Research suggests only about half of features pass this test but ScriptBook chief executive Nadira Azermai says it’s “extremely simple” for machines to assess gender inequality.
 Azermai is quick to say that her technology is focusing on helping to make scripts better, not writing new ones, but she admits that ScriptBook’s AI has written several on its own, though they’ve been “disappointing”. 
Belgian start-up Scriptbook aims to predict success at an even earlier stage by having their AI read your script and predict its chances of success.
 And, inevitably, Scriptbook and others are working to develop AIs that can credibly generate stories. 
 Nadira Azermai, of ScriptBook, spent a few days on the set of the $76 million Gigli when she was a student. 
The now defunct script analysis tool was rolled out in partnership with technology company ScriptBook.
 Perhaps the tool would not be equally helpful to all users; as screenwriter101 stated in a Reddit thread, which Leonard opened to address ScriptBook concerns: 
 We gave lots of freebies with this book like Faulaad magnet sticker, Faulaad rejected scriptbook (which was never released), Faulaad character card, Faulaad comics art print and Faulaad poster. 
 A Belgian AI company called Scriptbook developed an algorithm that the company claims can predict whether or not a film will be commercially successful just by analyzing the screenplay, according to Variety. 
 To justify the $5,000 expenditure over sometimes-free human labor, Scriptbook claims that its algorithm is three times better at predicting box office success than human readers. 
Scriptbook has yet to respond to Futurism’s multiple requests for information about its technology and the limitations of its algorithm (we will update this article if and when the company replies).
 Given how much artificial intelligence struggles with emotional communication, it’s unlikely that Scriptbook can provide the same level of comprehensive analysis that a person could. 
 But, to be fair, Scriptbook suggested to Variety that their system could be used to aid human readers, not replace them. 
 While it may seem like this takes a lot of the creative decision-making out of human hands, tools like Scriptbook can help studio houses make better financial choices — and it would be naïve to assume there was a time when they weren’t primarily motivated by the bottom line. 
 For example, the article refers to an experiment whereby an AI tool built by ScriptBook—another company that’s placed itself at the intersection of entertainment and artificial intelligence—was able to predict which films would be profitable with 86 percent accuracy as opposed to human executives’ 44 percent. 
 That means AI, or at the very least ScriptBook’s AI, is already nearly twice as effective as people at determining which films will be profitable. 
I recently learned about an AI program called ScriptBook from a Belgium-based company that analyzes screenplays to determine which will be a box-office success and which will be a flop.
 Rowling was nominated for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Little, Brown), “the unexpected addition to the Harry Potter canon” and the only play or “scriptbook” to have ever made the shortlist. 
ScriptBook launched in 2015 as an algorithmic assessment to determine a script’s box-office potential.
There is even an app called ScriptBook that claims to algorithmically determine whether a given screenplay will be successful.
 Not from the standpoint of money, according to ScriptBook. 
 ScriptBook is designed to make an “objective” assessment of a film’s commercial value based on a few key variables: actors, plot, and ending. 
 Scriptbook is also faster, meaning more scripts can be “considered.” 
 Like most movie executives, ScriptBook is likely to be good at picking a sure thing, but has all the signs of struggling to predict black swan events, or those incalculable moments when art takes a big step forward, or to the left or right. 
ScriptBook hasn’t demonstrated the ability to catch that magic in a bottle yet.
 There is one other concern with ScriptBook; if it’s judging art against what has come before it, its fate may be to perpetuate some of the racist assumptions prevalent in its contemporary entertainment industry.

Verdict Pros SmartBeam significantly improves WiFi range & performance
 With the ‘DIR-645’ D-Link is back for more and this time it comes wielding yet another new technology, ‘SmartBeam’. 
 Whereas most proprietary router technology focuses on prioritising important traffic over a network, SmartBeam is different. 
 D-Link claims SmartBeam is a genuine breakthrough in addressing the range and (by association) speed problems of 802.11n, boasting “strong and stable Internet connection in every corner of your house”. 
The difference is with SmartBeam aboard the DIR-645 remains strong in practice…
 Once you do start browsing it quickly becomes clear that, unlike so many recent router technologies, SmartBeam is the real deal. 
 At two metres the DIR-657 manages 49Mbit (6.13MB per second) – a respectable speed, but the SmartBeam equipped DIR-645 maintained a steady 82.4Mbit (10.3MB per second) genuinely delivering powerful performance from its ‘N 300’ (300Mbit theoretical maximum) specification. 
 The reason for a strict comparison between these two routers is they have launched from the same company at almost the same time with SmartBeam the primary difference between them (the DIR-657 uses D-Link’s traffic prioritisation technology, HD Fuel). 
That said it isn’t only against single band routers that SmartBeam excels.
The dual band D-Link DIR-825 uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels yet it was unable to match SmartBeam using 5GHz at two metres (69Mbit) while at distance 5GHz dropped away completely and 2.4GHz performed little better than the DIR-657.
All of which suggests D-Link is onto a winner with SmartBeam in general and the DIR-645 in particular.
That said D-Link is working on a dual band Smartbeam router for 2012 (will it have 12 antennas?!) so some may wish to wait.
Having lost faith in the innumerable gimmicks designed to bolster the ageing 802.11n wireless standard we were amazed to find D-Link has cracked it with SmartBeam.
 For example, D-Link calls it “Advanced AC SmartBeam.” 
 MALDI-2 requires a second laser (266 nm) fired orthogonally into the expanding MALDI plume that is generated by Bruker's proprietary primary SmartBeam 3D (355 nm) laser, the firm said. 
 The truck has been updated to include a SmartBeam-controlled light bar, which uses machine vision to optimize forward lighting without blinding preceding traffic, and a brand-new, forward-facing DVR (digital video recorder) pod. 
 This year, the truck also gets a companion vehicle: a heavily modified Polaris RZR with a complementary Michigan-themed wrap, SmartBeam-controlled light bar, R-Series FDM, and other Gentex technologies. 
 Drive Assist Pack features Adaptive Cruise Control and Automatic Emergency Braking, while the Safety Pack adds Driver Attention Alert, PEUGEOT Smartbeam Assistance, speed limit recognition and recommendation, Active Lane Keeping Assistance and Active Blind Spot Detection. 
Advanced AC SmartBeam - Tracks connected devices for enhanced Wi-Fi speed and range
 With D-Link's AC SmartBeam and MU-MIMO technologies, this router is able to distribute data more efficiently to devices, allowing for more consistent Wi-Fi speeds in all areas of the home. 
 Finally D-Link has married the best features of its 802.11n products into a single model: the 845L gets the dual band 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas and ‘mydlink’ Cloud platform support of the disappointing DIR-826L and ‘SmartBeam’, the superlative performance enhancing technology, of the single band, Cloudless DIR-645 all rolled into one. 
 Most noteworthy for day-to-day use is SmartBeam, which has made its way into the 802.11ac standard. 
Unlike normal 802.11b/g/n routers SmartBeam means a router doesn’t throw out a blind signal of equal radius but instead detects the location of devices connected to it and boosts signal in their direction.
 The Safety Plus Pack adds PEUGEOT’s Smartbeam Assistance, which automatically activates or de-activates full beam depending on the conditions and traffic, as well as Active Blind Spot Detection – giving you a warning in the wing mirrors about adjacent traffic that you’re either overtaking or being overtaken by. 
 As well as offering lightning-fast Wi-Fi speeds, for consumers looking to stream 4K movies, enjoy seamless online gaming, transfer large files and browse the Internet with more devices simultaneously, both Wi-Fi Gigabit Routers come with Multiple-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) with Advanced AC SmartBeam™. 
 MU-MIMO technology allows routers to send and receive large amounts of data to and from devices simultaneously, markedly increasing throughput and application responsiveness, whilst Advanced AC SmartBeam™ steers the wireless signal to where it is needed to dramatically improve wireless range.

 The new MALDI Biotyper sirius uses the proprietary smartbeam™ solid-state laser with a 200 Hz repetition rate, and a lifetime of 500 million shots. 
This essentially makes the smartbeam a 'lifetime laser' in typical microbiology laboratories.
 Standard are a raft of safety features inherited from the Active such as lane keep assist, advanced driver attention alert, active safety brake and Smartbeam assistance. 
 The new expanded claim 3 library is now available in the US on two different versions of Bruker´s MALDI Biotyper CA system, either based on the standard microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, or on the high-end microflex smart, which uses Bruker´s proprietary smartbeam™ laser. 
 Under typical microbial identification conditions, the 200 Hz smartbeam is a 'lifetime laser' for microbial identification, decreases time-to-result and increases throughput. 
 Rain-sensing wipers, SmartBeam headlamps, power-folding mirrors and power-sliding rear window with defrost also joined the lineup as available options in 2013. 
 The company, with $624 million in sales in 2008, has told shareholders it expects demand to build for its camera-display mirrors and other high-profit innovations such as its SmartBeam headlights. 
Its three 5dBi dual-band dipole antennas are significantly larger than anything we’ve seen on any rival router (which usually stick to 3Bi) and they are backed by SmartBeam compliance.
 By combining the speed of Bruker’s patented Smartbeam™ 3D laser technology with the direct-detection capability of mass spectrometry, the rapifleX MALDI PharmaPulse (MPP) delivers unprecedented screening capability for High-Throughput Screening biochemical assays.

It seemed outrageously unacceptable that the Jaguars would devote a training camp roster spot to a 33-year-old who hasn't played football in six years and is attempting to transition from quarterback to tight end.
 There is, however, another way to view the training camp sideshow coming to Jacksonville later this summer, one that is decidedly less angry and more in line with NFL history. 
2004: Brock Lesnar in Minnesota Vikings camp
 Pro wrestler Brock Lesnar never played a regular-season NFL game, but he was in Vikings training camp. 
 Coach Mike Tice was hoping to spice up camp, if nothing else, and owner Red McCombs knew a winning sideshow when he saw one. 
1963: George Plimpton in Detroit Lions camp
Writer George Plimpton wrote a book about his experience at Lions camp.
 So he started pitching NFL teams on a training camp invite as a   last-string quarterback   to give him material for a book. 
 Author Stefan Fatsis persuaded the Denver Broncos to let him kick in their 2008 camp and later published a book titled   A Few Seconds of Panic.   
1982: Renaldo Nehemiah in San Francisco 49ers camp
 Washington figured it had the inside track on signing him, given Nehemiah's time as a University of Maryland student, but the 49ers swooped in with the first contract guarantees in franchise history to secure him as a training camp receiver. 
 1969: Jimmy   Oops   Hines in Miami Dolphins camp 
 But he had never played football before, and let's just say Hines earned his nickname during training camp. 
 1965:   Bullet   Bob Hayes in Dallas Cowboys camp 
 No one knew what to expect, but his impact was immediate: Hayes' speed was the talk of camp. 
 According to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network, star wide receiver Amari Cooper may not be ready for the start of training camp later this summer due to an ankle injury. 
 This ailment has Cooper sidelined during the club's mandatory minicamp, but Rapoport does characterize this injury as minor and more of an irritation that simply requires rest to fully be healed. 
 Because of the unlikelihood that Cooper will be able to go through proper conditioning over that stretch, he may not be in the playing shape he's accustomed to at the initial start of camp. 
 Of course, Dallas also begins training camp a bit earlier than most clubs this year due to their participation in the Hall of Fame Game, which also contributes to Cooper possibly beginning camp on the PUP list. 
   He won't participate the rest of the minicamp. 
 I'm just hopeful he'll be ready for training camp.   
 Denise Learned of Chester has recently won the Leadership and Service Award by the American Camp Association (ACA) of New England for her work at Camp Hazen YMCA, also located in Chester.

 Fire Information Status: Active Location: Camp Pendleton Percentage Contained: 20% Acres Burned: 1,000 Evacuations: Yes Evacuation Location: Paige Fieldhouse 
 A wildfire that blackened 1,000 acres of vegetation on the land of Camp Pendleton was 20% contained Tuesday morning, the base's public-affairs office said. 
 Authorities cleared people out of various areas on the installation Wednesday afternoon, including Lake O'Neill Campground, as a precaution. 
 A wildfire called the Sierra Fire has broken out around 2:30 p.m. east of the 33 area on Camp Pendleton, prompting mandatory evacuations. 
Camp Pendleton Fire Department is working to combat the blaze.
There are currently about 20 NSA members enrolled in the UTSA SDS bootcamp program which will run the entire month of June.
The SDS boot camp will develop participants’ knowledge and skills across 12 modules including:
“Intensive training programs like this boot camp are a great compliment to the degree programs at UTSA and our government partners.”
 Jaguars unlikely to get thorough evaluation of Tim Tebow until training camp Highlights few for Heisman winner, but key tests still to come 
 Working in helmet and shorts during offseason practices, which will wrap up with next week's mandatory minicamp, those questions can't be answered yet. 
 He plans to be   100%   come training camp in late July. 
 The men's and women's national teams will hold training camps in Las Vegas in July, they announced Thursday, and they'll be playing seven exhibitions there against other Olympic-bound national teams as well. 
 USA Basketball will open its men's training camp, led by coach Gregg Popovich, in Las Vegas on July 6. 
 The Olympic men's teams from Australia, Nigeria, Argentina and reigning Basketball World Cup champion Spain will also be spending some time in Las Vegas; Argentina will start its training camp there this month. 
The U.S. women's training camp under coach Dawn Staley will likely open around July 12; the WNBA break for the Olympics starts after the games of July 11.
 It'll all take place at the MGM Resorts, which was announced as USA Basketball's training camp home and resort partner with the sides having now agreed to a multiyear sponsorship deal. 
 Argentina's men's team is conducting the entirety of its three-week camp there before flying to Tokyo, simply because it believes a controlled environment and less traveling between different countries will minimize virus-related risks before the Olympics. 
 Last year, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, only 60 percent of summer day camps were held in person, according to the American Camp Association. 
 This year, following the May 28 release of updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for summer camps, local day camps are poised for a return to in-person activities. 
 Ma, who has run Code Ninjas since 2019, noted that it held its summer camp virtually last year due to the pandemic. 
 Last year’s economic slowdown hurt the coding center, Ma said, but he added that this year, things are looking “healthier” all around, and parents and campers are excited about a return to in-person camp activities. 
 The Code Ninjas summer camp, which debuted in June 2018, is slated to run from June 28 through the last week of August. 
 This year, its goal is to make the camp experience “new and fresh,” with new video game themes, Ma said. 
 Covid-19 concerns remain despite the desire of many summer camps to return to in-person activities, and many camps are implementing more stringent safety precautions. 
 Mindnasium, a children’s entertainment center in Franklin Square that focuses on science, technology, engineering, arts and math-related activities for children ages 4 to 10, is also holding an in-person summer camp this year. 
 Masks are required, and space for the camp is limited due to social distancing concerns. 
 “To help ensure maximum protections for staff and children at child care and camp programs, we are issuing this guidance so the facilities can implement basic but critical measures that will allow them to operate safely.” 
 The CDC’s May 28 update for summer camps recommended vaccination for all employees and campers who are eligible, and noted that fully vaccinated camp environments are allowed to return to in-person activities at full capacity, without masking and social distancing, 
 The CDC also stressed that “camp programs should be supportive of campers or staff who choose to wear a mask,” and that outdoor and socially distanced activities are preferable at camps where not everyone is vaccinated. 
The Cowboys are wrapping up the offseason program with this week's three-day minicamp.
Then it's a month-plus layoff until training camp gets underway.
Wright wants to carry his momentum into the preseason with the same mindset he's had in OTAs and minicamp.
2022 defensive back/slot/H-back Derrick Buggi had an impressive first day of camp.
He did not participate in the camp due to baseball obligations.
He didn’t attend the Saturday jamboree because he was at the Lindenwood Mega Camp.
He did more of the individual drills and team run game with Burke and missed the jamboree due to the Lindenwood Mega Camp.
The USMNT closed out a June camp that went better than anyone could have expected.
 It took all of them being in camp together—Christian Pulisic (22 yrs), Weston McKennie (22 yrs), Tyler Adams (22 yrs) and Gio Reyna (18 yrs)—and then also being the primary reason the U.S. won games that actually mattered. 
The USMNT camp also handed down five important verdicts as far as how the team is managed and constructed in the future:
 In his fourth straight start in this camp, it was another smart, composed performance from McKenzie, who went 45 minutes. 
He was probably itching for this start after being left off the Nations League roster and sticking around in camp all this time.
 He may have only arrived in camp the day before (as a replacement for Matt Miazga), but he didn’t hold anything back when he came on at halftime. 
 The Earthquakes midfielder can depart camp on an upbeat note, coming on for the last half hour with the result in hand. 
 A 1,000-acre brush fire on Camp Pendleton continued to burn on Thursday but officials said it was 20% contained by 5 a.m. 
 The fire broke out around 3 p.m. on Wednesday and forced mandatory evacuations in several areas of the base, including the Lake O’Neill Campground and near the Wounded Warrior Battalion. 
 When the fire started, at least 100 engines from fire departments in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Deigo counties were on scene and helping the Camp Pendleton fire department with the blaze. 
It’s good on good and big on big at FSU’s big man camp; four-star offensive tackle Elijah Pritchett who just wrapped up his official visit is already back on FSU’s campus:
Big thanks to @CoachAAtkins @Coach_Norvell for a great camp experience today.

The prevalence of torture and the lengths to which the Chinese government has gone to cover up its treatment of Muslim minorities are described in comprehensive detail in an Amnesty International report on detention camps in Western China.
 Every former camp detainee Amnesty interviewed in the report recounted cruel and degrading treatment, including torture. 
 The report, released Thursday, is based on interviews with 108 people, including 55 camp survivors and several government cadres who worked in the camps. 
 As part of an attempt to hide camp conditions from the world, Chinese officials created a massive, nearly week-long bonfire, burning as many documents as could be found from an office overseeing the camps, according to an ex-cadre who spoke to Amnesty and whose identity has been concealed for his safety. 
 The report also gives a behind the scenes look at the   tours   of the camps that the government gives to international journalists, which are meant to paint the facilities, which Chinese officials call   re-education camps,   in a positive light. 
The document burning occurred in 2019 following a leak of a trove of official Chinese government documents revealing the high-level organization and planning of the internment camps.
A coordinated government effort to control information about the camps in the wake of the leak was first reported by the Associated Press.
 Chinese authorities in the western region of Xinjiang have been rounding up women and men — largely Muslims from the Uighur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz ethnic minorities — and detaining them in camps designed to rid them of terrorist or extremist leanings since 2017. 
 More than 1 million Uighurs and other minorities from Xinjiang are believed to be held in internment camps, where they are forced to study Marxism, renounce their religion, work in factories and face abuse, according to human rights groups and first-hand accounts. 
 Beijing says these   re-education camps   provide vocational training and are necessary to fight extremism. 
One former detainee whose identity has been concealed for his safety told Amnesty he and others were coached for days on what to say to foreign journalists and even Chinese government delegations visiting from Beijing who were given camp tours.
Forty-four of the 55 former detainees had never shared any part of their stories publicly before and their accounts represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation inside the internment camps since 2017.
 Amnesty separated the torture or ill-treatment into two categories: that which took place as the results of daily life in the camps, and that which occurred during interrogations or as punishment for   misbehavior   by specific detainees. 
The former detainee also told Amnesty he later learned the man had died in the camp.
 LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Summer camp is officially back in session, much to the delight of 7-year-old Arthur LaVelle and his friends who spent a recent day playing one of their favorite games. 
 Last summer, Arthur’s parents decided to keep him home as COVID cases surged across Southern California even though his camp stayed open. 
The pandemic has changed summer camps considerably.
 At Tom Sawyer Camp in Altadena, COVID protocols start before campers even enter the property. 
 “We know so much more today than we did last year this time about COVID,” Sarah Fish, the camp’s executive director, said. 
 Mealhero, a Belgium-based frozen meal kit delivery service, has raised €2.5 million (~$2.97M USD) in funding. 
 Mealhero’s CEO, Jeroen Spitaels announced the fundraise via a Linkedin post today (though according to Crunchbase, the close date was November 1). 
 The lead investor is Mealhero’s new round is Jan Haspeslagh, whose family is behind the European frozen meal giant Ardo. 
 The founders of Deliverect and Bavet also participated, and this brings Mealhero’s current total funding to €3.5M (~$4.15M USD). 
Mealhero is a little different from other players in the meal kit space.
Mealhero is doubling its workforce to 60 employees.
 Mealhero has expanded into the Netherlands, and has plans to expand to other countries across Europe. 
 With a deep-frozen alternative to the well-known chilled meal boxes, Ghent-based startup Mealhero wants to conquer more European countries in addition to Belgium and the Netherlands. 
Mealhero provides fresh frozen ingredients that consumers can easily prepare at home in an intelligent steamer.
 The corona crisis caused an acceleration in growth, but also put enormous pressure on the operational chain, says CEO Jeroen Spitaels, who strongly believes in the advantages of the Mealhero concept:   You often see that a traditional food box only solves a small part of the cooking problem. 
 In just two years, Mealhero has grown to become one of the top three foodboxes in Belgium, the team has grown from 3 to 30 people and the number of customers from 1 to several thousands. 
 Mealhero, the European meal kit delivery startup, announced at the end of last week that it has raised a €900,000 (~$1.04 million) seed round of funding. 
The Belgium-based Mealhero differentiates itself from other meal kit services on the market through its combination of frozen food and a dedicated connected cooking appliance.
 The mealhero service is comprised of three parts: a box of frozen ingredients delivered to your home, an app to help you assemble your ingredients into a recipe, and a connected three-container steamer to cook them automatically. 
 The app knows what [Mealhero] ingredients you have and can suggest a recipe, or you can assemble a combination of foods how you like. 
 One of the benefits of Mealhero’s approach is that since it ships frozen food, the ingredients will last longer, so you can make them when you like. 
 This new seed funding adds to the €79,151 Mealhero raised on Kickstarter last year as well as an undisclosed amount of funding the company had prior to Kickstarter. 
 The Mealhero device is available for purchase (the company’s website says 100 smart steamers are available for delivery at the end of Sept.), with the Starter Pack costing €299 (~$350 USD). 
Mealhero was also a finalist at the Startup Showcase at our first Smart Kitchen Summit: Europe earlier this year.
 Mealhero, a two-year old startup based in Belgium, wants to have overcome these issues through a combination of frozen food plus connected high-tech steamer, and have taken to Kickstarter to expand their European footprint. 
 Quick note: It’s not easy to suss out all the mealhero details outside of the subtitled Kickstarter video, as almost all of their promotional materials are in Dutch. 
 UPDATE: Jeroen Spitaels, Co-Founder and CEO of mealhero, emailed us back with answers to our questions, which are pasted below. 
 The mealhero service is comprised of three parts: a box of frozen ingredients delivered to your home, an app to help you assemble your ingredients into a recipe, and a connected three-container steamer to cook them automatically. 
 According to mealhero’s Kickstarter video, they offer 100 ingredients, which can be combined into 300 different meals. 
 While most people probably don’t want every meal steamed, mealhero does seems to be taking the friction between meal kit delivery and actual usage. 
 Mealhero currently has customers in Belgium and the Netherlands, and is using Kickstarter to raise $75,000 to grow the business. 
Jeroen Spitaels: mealhero is available in Belgium and The Netherlands.
5. How much to does mealhero cost?
Let’s see what Mealhero has to offer.
 Mealhero (founded in 2017) is a Gent-based foodtech startup that combines a smart steamer, home-delivered food boxes and an app to prepare you a healthy and delicious meal with zero effort. 
 He’s the cofounder of Mealhero, a Belgian startup which combines a frozen meal kit service with a connected countertop steamer. 
 Head to the SKS Europe blog to read our Q&A with Spitaels and learn what inspired him to start Mealhero, the power of a good vacation, and why he wants a smart tech chef in every home. 
 With a deep-frozen alternative to the well-known chilled meal boxes, Ghent-based startup Mealhero wants to conquer more European countries in addition to Belgium and the Netherlands. 
Mealhero provides fresh frozen ingredients that consumers can easily prepare at home in an intelligent steamer.

 In the video below, IDLab demonstrates how a home robot working in conjunction with a connected cooking device like mealhero’s can help people with diabetes watch their carbohydrate intake and regulate their insulin accordingly. 
 It’s also pretty complicated, requiring the robot, a mealhero meal plan and steamer, a connected food scale and a calculator to figure out the carb count of a meal to enter into an insulin pump. 
A product like mealhero works in this scenario because it has a standardized set of ingredients that are shipped individually and its connected cooking device automatically cooks the food.
 Companies profiled in this report include LG, Samsung, Vitamix, Smarter, Ovie, Bluapple, Mimica, Blakbear, Silo, Mealhero, MealBoard, Kitche, No Waste, Ends & Stems, and Olio. 
 It’s not strictly vegan, but Mealhero’s business model also reminds me of Allplants: the Belgium-based company recently raised $1.04 million for its meal kit service which combines frozen meals with a connected cooking appliance. 
 Mealhero is using the money to expand farther into Europe, said it will roll out in Belgium and The Netherlands in September 2018. 
 Called Meal Hero [note: different than the Belgian frozen meal kit/connected cooking device startup Mealhero], the app has a “Food Intelligence Platform” that tracks users’ preferences to recommend recipes based off of their dietary restrictions, favorite ingredients, top cuisines, etc. 
 After selecting a recipe on the mealhero app, users receive a box of fresh-frozen ingredients which they can cook in the connected countertop steamer. 
Mealhero Raises €2.5M for Its Frozen Meals-by-Mail Service – The Belgium-based company says it’s quadrupled its customer base and doubled the number of orders since the pandemic.
Belgian startup Mealhero is combining meal delivery service with frozen food and a “smart steamer” to help you cook it in no time.
 There are quite a few startups similar to Mealhero available in the US, but those who have tried it know that it has some key differences. 
 We’ve seen that innovation in frozen food firsthand from companies like Mealhero, which ships pre-packaged frozen food and connected steam cooker to automatically prepare them. 
 First, there are the up-and-coming smart appliance makers like Mealhero, Tovala and Suvie. 
 In the horeca and food industry new concepts like meal boxes (like HelloFresh or Foodbag), prepared meal services (like Mealhero), virtual restaurants (also called Dark Kitchens), living room and concept restaurants…​ force the traditional horeca also to work more efficiently and to consolidate in chains or to find their specific niche (of clientele). 
 Belgian-based Mealhero sells frozen meal components, though you need its countertop steamer in order to cook them. 
 Belgian Mealhero also makes frozen meal kits, but they’ve taken the operation a few steps further with a recipe app and connected countertop steamer. 
 “Because they’re starting with frozen food (with a long shelf life), our community is able to plug and play Mealhero food into their schedule whenever they need it the most,” he told me. 
 Meanwhile, over in Belgium, Mealhero is doing just that, selling frozen food meal kits components that you can mix and match and reheat in an accompanying countertop appliance. 
Belgium’s Mealhero has created a steamer to go with its frozen food delivery services.

Realo Discount Drug will be offering the Moderna Vaccine for healthcare workers and other first-line employees that qualify for Phase 1A as well as people who are over the age of 65.
 “We have 100 vaccines available,” said Hardy Creech, owner of Realo Discount Drugs. 
Snow Hill police say a man managed to jimmy the lock on a side door at Realo Drugs on Parkwood Drive.
 On Monday, Realo Discount Pharmacy will begin administering the single-dose shot again for the first time in weeks at all 17 of their locations. 
 “As long as the patients are aware of what to monitor for and when to go seek medical attention – we are ready to get back underway and offer this vaccine,   said Anna Baird from Realo Drugs in Fuquay-Varina. 
Vaccines at Realo locations are by appointment only.
 Realo in Four Oaks in Johnston County is one of those smaller, local pharmacies now helping distribute the vaccine. 
 Realo Discount Drugs has vaccine available at locations in Four Oaks, Kinston and Smithfield. 
Realo Drugs in Fuquay-Varina has the Johnson & Johnson vaccine available by appointment.
 After a brief flirtation with revolutionary communism at university, by 1980 Mr Kretschmann had found his voice on the moderate “Realo” wing of the newly formed German Green Party. 
 For all the hand-wringing, Mr Kretschmann’s centrism has carried the day in the national party, now firmly in the hands of Realos and gearing up to enter government after a general election in September. 
 The duo is controversial within the party, given that both hail from the centrist wing (often referred to as the   realos” — as opposed to the fundamentalist   fundis  ) - leaving the left wing to feel underrepresented. 
 Charismatic, folksy, the first-generation German and self-described   Anatolian Swabian,” Özdemir is in many ways the ideal face for the Green party - a party which has been both hailed and criticized for its bold embrace of multiculturalism - even if his centrist   realo   views have put him at odds with the Greens' pacifist and socialist sections. 
Anna Baird with Realo Drugs in Fuquay-Varina said they will soon start offering the J&J shot as well.
 However, more pragmatic “Realo” politicians found that there were rewards for activism, even when the levers of power remained out of reach. 
Realo Drugs in Pender County receives vaccine supply.
One of two masked and armed robbers enters the Realo Pharmacy in Hampstead last night.
 HAMPSTEAD — Pender County deputies are searching for two people wearing coats and masks, armed with handguns, who robbed the Realo Pharmacy in Hampstead last night. 
 Pink Hill Pharmacy and Realo Drug of Pink Hill have both long been staples in the community, providing exemplary customer service to the residents of southern Lenoir County and the surrounding areas. 
 Since July 1998, Mike Wiggins, Lenoir County native and owner of Realo Discount Drug of Pink Hill, has served the community at his store just around the corner, carrying on the tradition of local service and excellence started by the Brewer and Watson families, which began in the same location in the 1950s. 
 Researchers used data from Realo Specialty Care, a community-based independent specialty pharmacy that is part of a larger group of 18 independent pharmacies in eastern North Carolina. 
 “The study suggests that pharmacist involvement in the PA process can be beneficial to patient medication access,” wrote the authors, who included both pharmacy executives from Realo as well as faculty from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
 The success of the Greens’ two leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, who have cemented the party in second place in polls, seemed to have ended tensions between the Greens’ centrist Realo and radical Fundi wings. 
 An interesting point here is that the Baerbock/Habeck era at the Greens has often been marked by dealing with one of the party’s identity conflicts by being more ambitious on the others – for example, trying to transcend the realo/fundi split by running to the left on social and economic policy and arguing for the exclusion of capital investment from the so-called debt-brake – and picking Baerbock could be understood in this light. 
Winston also said they have partnered with several businesses and Realo Drugs to hand out recruitment fliers.
In recent years the party has overcome the brutal past ­battles between its realo (pragmatic) and fundi (idealistic) wings.
 Baerbock and Habeck, both realos, have presided over remarkable unity and discipline. 
 Having in 1993 merged with Alliance 90, a product of the old East German civil rights movement, the Greens had moderated some of their positions ­under the realo pre-eminence of Fischer and in 1998 had formed the “red-green” government with Schröder. 
 An ­undogmatic realo who communicated in clear, emotive language and was at one with the black-green zeitgeist, he was the obvious front-runner. 
 Baerbock, though a realo, concluded (in the words of a friend) “fuck it, I’ll do it” and seized the initiative. 
 Under Baerbock and her co-party leader Robert Habeck, who have run the party jointly since 2018, the Greens have developed into a major centrist force in German politics—including on foreign policy, where they’ve helped soothe tensions between the party’s traditionally left-wing fundis and more pragmatic realos (despite both coming from the realo camp themselves). 
 Under then-German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a realo, the party backed the decision to send German troops into Kosovo as part of the NATO campaign against ethnic cleansing—the first time Germany’s military had been deployed into a conflict since World War II. 
 “It’s not a question of right wing or left, realos or fundis. 
 But at a congress in the northern city of Hanover, delegates elected Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, both from the party’s “Realo” wing, a move that could create fiercer competition for the beleaguered SPD. 
Fourth-year UVA student Jackson Realo and his classmates stood quietly at dusk as they read the mural’s inscription:
 Realo grew up in Baltimore, but he said he went to a private all-boys school before college and was largely unaware of the history of the city’s black community before taking Grandison’s course. 
 “At first I was kind of hesitant to delve into it, but Professor Grandison is so enthusiastic and passionate that he really engages you,” Realo said. 
Corradengo was arrested earlier this year after an investigation found he was taking the same victim's medications from Realo Pharmacy in Surf City.
 Paige Killingsworth, RPh, PharmD, at Realo Discount Drugs in Trenton, North Carolina, was able to decipher the first half of this prescription, but the second half required a call to the prescriber. 
 In addition to his professional association involvement and work at the university, he is a part-time pharmacist at Realo Discount Drug in Lillington. 
Both Habeck and Baerbock hail from the realo or pragmatic wing of the German Greens – a first in the 30-year history of a party that grew out of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and first entered parliament in 1983.
 “The development of the CareOne app is a great example of how we listen and respond to our customers’ needs,” said Jenny Realo, executive vice president of CareOne Services. 
 Tunde Akande recently emerged the new Captain of Tiger Golf Club (TGC) Ibadan, which is situated inside the Second Division of the Nigeria Army; Adekunle Fajuyi Military Cantonment, Odogbo Barracks Ojoo, Ibadan. 
 NISER moved out of the University of Ibadan to its headquarters at Ojoo, Ibadan in 1987. 
 “A distress call was received on the early hours of Monday, May 31, at about 0300 hours by residents of Alafia Estate, Ojoo area of Ibadan. 
 Two persons have been reportedly killed and several others injured in an attack on Ojoo police station in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, as the ongoing protest continues across the country. 
The protest at the Agodi area was said to be peaceful except at the Ojoo end of the Lagos/ Ibadan expressway where there was a face-off between security operatives and the protesters.
 We have invested millions of naira and we already have 14 locations identified by the ministry where we will put the public toilets like Iwo road, Ojoo, challenge and major markets among others.” 
THE Federal Government has disclosed that four pedestrian bridges would be introduced between Ibadan tollgate and Ojoo in the course of the ongoing reconstruction of the Lagos – Ibadan road project.
 He said: “Because of the end result on this road, we are introducing four pedestrian bridges between Ojoo and Tollgate as a result of the heavy build-up areas and the density is quite high.” 
 Adebiyi further explained: “Ibadan tollgate and Ojoo is one of the busiest section of the Lagos -Ibadan project, and the traffic volume – both vehicular and human is high, azzle load is quite high also.” 
 The Federal Highways director disclosed that Gov Seyi Makinde had agreed that they needed to come back and dedicate a date when both of them would go round the FG projects going on in the state, “especially Tollgate to Ojoo section of the Lagos -Ibadan Highway. 
 In some areas including Beere, Oje, Labiran, Oja’ba, Ojoo, Ajibode among others, many youths seized the opportunity to engage in street football while those that are moving around are charged higher fares. 
 It started when a Yoruba cobbler was reportedly killed by a Hausa wheelbarrow pusher in Sasa, Ojoo area. 
I was around Ojoo when the incident happened.
 The land is located at Ojoo, along Ibadan – Oyo road, in Akiinyele Local Government Area of the state. 
 “For the Southwest zone, we chose to promote gemstone trading, which is already going on in Ibadan – as an informal market in Ojoo area of the state.” 
 “Then, move the informal market at Ojoo to this place after its completion,” he said. 
From Elebu I decided to take a Bike all the way to Ojoo which brings me closer to the train station and I could decide to take a cab or another bike.
 It was a cold January morning and the bike ride to Ojoo seemed to take forever with my facemask doing its utmost best to appear to cover my face (never mind about my nose and mouth), water streaming out of my eyes, and me pretending to keep up a conversation with the rider even though I couldn’t hear a word. 
We got to Ojoo and I gladly disembarked from the bike and approached a cabman who insisted he would only take a charter to the train station and insisted on charging twice the fare I paid from my house.
There was a light chatter amongst passengers about an ongoing situation developing in the Ojoo area.
Four of us cramped into the Taxi and off we went into the unknown that was the Moniya-Ojoo axis that night.
 After this frightening encounter, it was smooth sailing all the way to Ojoo and down to the University of Ibadan and the rest of Ibadan. 
 The youth in Ibadan, Oyo state capital, have barricaded the Ojoo area of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway in protest against police brutality. 
 A roadblock was also mounted in front of the police station in Ojoo in Akinyele local government area, forcing police officers to remain inside the station. 
 Bazira and Dybul serve as co-directors of the new center, and Holmes is joined by Sylvia Ojoo, MBChB, DTM&H, MRCP, as faculty co-directors of CGHPI. 
 In addition to her role as faculty co-director, Ojoo, also serves as resident director and develop new programs in eastern Africa. 
 Ojoo and Gobir both worked with Bazira at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) where he led an extensive program implementation and research portfolio, as founding director of the Center for International Health, Education, and Biosecurity at the Institute of Human Virology, which included programs in ten sub-Saharan and two Caribbean countries. 
 Bazira first met his global health colleagues, Gobir and Ojoo, in Nigeria and Kenya respectively working to scale up HIV care and treatment at the beginning of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 14 years ago. 
 Over the past 11 years, Ojoo has led the development, and implementation, and has ensured the technical quality of large-scale HIV care and treatment programs across all levels of health institutions in Kenya, serving over 100,000 patients on antiretroviral treatment.

 Law360 (June 9, 2021, 6:50 PM EDT) -- The operators of 23 U.S. strip clubs have urged the Ninth Circuit to revive their suit seeking to force a Lloyd's of London syndicate to cover their claimed business losses stemming from government-issued COVID-19 closure orders, saying physical damage isn't required to trigger physical loss in the policy.The strip clubs and an   adult superstore   — led by Rialto Pockets Inc. 
 must cover their physical loss from not being able to operate their businesses during pandemic lockdowns, despite a California federal court finding that physical damage or alteration to the insured property is required before the policy kicks in.And while Beazley said dispossession of property could constitute physical loss under the policy as long as it's a permanent dispossession, the clubs argued that this interpretation of the policy doesn't hold up.  Beazley's policy provides for recovery if Rialto is 'wholly or partially prevented from ... 
 continuing business operations or services,' and is devoid of any language that would alert Rialto that a temporary physical loss of real property is not covered,   the clubs said.The strip clubs, saying that their policy with the Lloyd's syndicate does not exclude loss caused by government orders and that none of the policy exclusions apply. 
 coverage for 'physical loss' exists only if there is a 'direct [permanent] physical loss' or understand why the policy's promise to pay for the 'partial' cessation of business operations does not exist when the interruption of business operations is occasioned by 'physical loss,'   the clubs said.The clubs asked the appellate court to reverse the trial court's ruling and revive their suit.Representatives for the parties did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.The clubs are represented by Stanley H. Shure , Peter E. Garrell and Salvatore Picariello of Fortis LLP Beazley is represented by W. Eric Blumhardt, Julian J. Pardini II and Rebecca R.

San Antonio home builder Rialto Homes has been experiencing “unprecedented volatility” in the cost of construction materials and labor since the fall.
Rialto told some of its buyers last month that it was raising the price on homes they already had agreed to purchase in response to the higher costs.
 Rialto informed buyers Rosalinda and Rigoberto Montero in a May 20 letter that the costs to build their four-bedroom, 4½-bathroom home in the Preserve at Mission Valley in New Braunfels had risen $75,799. 
 Rialto had agreed to absorb a third of the increased cost, leaving the Monteros on the hook for roughly an additional $50,000 if they chose to proceed. 
 Rialto, in explaining why it could increase the price, referred to an addendum in the Monteros’ sales agreement that compensates it for additional costs incurred if the the couple failed to meet timelines for making structural and “deco” selections for their home. 
Montero admitted she didn’t notice the deadlines imposed by Rialto.
 Montero’s niece’s contract with Rialto also was canceled after it notified her the cost of her home had increased by $40,288. 
 Again, Rialto offered to cover a third of that increase. 
 “In our complete history as a homebuilder, Rialto has absorbed cost increases and honored the prices contemplated by the agreements with customers,” the builder told the Monteros. 
Rialto co-owner Eyal Avnon denied this was simply a maneuver by the builder to capitalize on the white-hot housing market.
Rialto had not actually started construction on the house for the Monteros.
 Rialto said the terms of the agreement specified it could keep their $10,000 deposit in the event of a default. 
 Rialto, however, refunded the entire amount in return for the couple agreeing not to take any legal action against it. 
 “We are not mad at Rialto, just disappointed,” Montero said.

 “Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Rialto’s doors have been and remain closed, but that did not stop our team from producing nearly 60 online events on a shoestring budget,” said Lee Foster, executive director of the Rialto Center for the Arts. 
 “We have a lot to celebrate in terms of resiliency during our ‘pandemic season,’ but we need the public’s support and financial contributions to sustain the Rialto as we plan for our ‘re-opening’ season currently set for the 2021-22 GSU academic year.” 
 In response to mandatory COVID-19 closures starting in March 2020, the Rialto quickly pivoted to create several online offerings, including the launch of their popular Feed Your Senses, Live at the Rialto and the 
 Rialto Homegrown Artists series, empowering Georgia-based artists to keep performing publicly while connecting with audiences in new ways. 
 The Rialto also forged partnerships in the community and on Georgia State University’s campus to produce five “Crucial Conversations” episodes so far, encouraging important conversations on race and diversity. 
Organizations who wish to contribute to the silent auction may do so by contacting Lee Foster via email to Rialto@gsu.edu or by calling 404-413-9825.

 Such is the case of the Kobelco SK17SR-3E, which has just been re-launched with a number of new features and important design improvements. 
 With this in mind, the Kobelco SK17SR-3E’s working environment has been significantly upgraded with a deluxe Grammar-branded reclining seat to improve operator comfort. 
 Ideal for jobsites where space is restricted, the Kobelco SK17SR-3E combines a compact design with wide digging reach for efficient performance, excellent manoeuvrability and durability. 
The SK17SR-3E’s retractable crawlers (990mm) provide additional accessibility on confined job sites and allow the machine to pass through spaces as narrow as 1m wide.
 When it comes to durability, the SK17SR-3E features a forged boom top and bolt-tightened pins and a boom cylinder guard, which protects the cylinder from damage while at work. 
 As part of Kobelco’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, the SK17SR-3E is also now Stage V compliant. 
 In the case of the SK17SR-3E, the machine is not only competitive in terms of arm crowding force (8.7 kN) and bucket digging force (15.2 kN), but its newly designed and comfortable interior also makes it particularly attractive to operators,” said KCME product manager, Peter Stuij.

 Dr Nielsen’s framework for an embodied, embedded, and enactive (3E) concept of mental disorder1,2, explored in detail in his thesis, has substantial overlap with Dr de Haan’s framework but also has meaningful differences in emphasis. 
 In this interview, we discuss how he applies the 3E conceptual framework to psychiatry, and how his approach differs from Dr de Haan’s. 
 You develop your account of psychopathology within the 3E (Embodied, Embedded, and Enactive) framework, and conclude that mental disorders are dysfunctions in the behavioral and experiential processes of striving organisms, constituted by relatively stable dynamic patterns (networks of phenomena) within the brain-body-environment system.

 With 3E Conversion Graduate, the company overcomes these challenges to achieve three core objectives: 
 Patricia Maben, 3E’s president, describes how the company came to develop the solution. 
 At 3E, as we developed our highly successful undergraduate 3E Conversion solution we saw how the same principles could be applied to a graduate audience. 
 3E’s process begins very differently, rooted in a persona-based approach that reflects those diffuse motivations and backgrounds of prospects.

3E Conversion Graduate powerfully utilizes email across the spectrum of the decision process.
 While the 3E Conversion Graduate campaign is a powerful solution on its own, its top strength for an admission team is the real-time intelligence that it provides. 
3E Graduate Conversion is the only comprehensive graduate enrollment marketing solution in the industry.

Allied Machine & Engineering has announced the expansion of Wohlhaupter digital tools offered with external 3E Tech digital display for micro precision adjustment range measurement.
The company is successfully converting a series of precision boring tools with built-in digital displays to include 3E Tech.
 3E Tech combines precision adjustment measurement in the tool with an external, dockable and detachable digital display that shows the adjustment setting. 
The 3E Tech display unit docks onto the tool and is activated via a pushbutton.
 Because the display attaches externally and is not integral, it can be used with all Allied Machine/Wohlhaupter tools that are equipped with 3E Tech sensor units. 
This is not the case with 3E Tech as the measured values are stored in the tool itself to prevent data loss.
 “From now on, all our tools from the smallest to the largest diameter will be equipped with 3E Tech, and it will be optionally available on special tools. 
Features of the 3E Tech digital display:

 Digital transformation enabled the successful Virtual Opening of 3E Accounting Limited in Hong Kong in July 2020 despite COVID-19 through digital tools like multiple video conferencing platforms, Cloud computing and Google Workspace. 
Investment in technology has enabled 3E Accounting to transcend geographical barriers in its overseas expansion through systematic business continuity planning.

 In what could be a new tactic by the Biden administration to deter the daily incursions by Chinese warplanes in Taiwan's ADIZ, aircraft spotters detected a USN Lockheed EP-3E ARIES II electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft flying on a nearly parallel path with a People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Shaanxi Y-8G electronic aircraft. 
 Internationally recognised jewellery brand Baunat, founded in Belgium in 2008, has become one of the first to accept cryptocurrency payments for its products. 
 Meanwhile, executive director, Steven Boelens, added: “Baunat has always been an early adopter when it comes to technology and in today’s economic climate it’s easy to see the added value of a payment technology that’s on the verge of exploding into the mainstream market.” 
Baunat is not the first jewellery industry company to add cryptocurrency as an accepted payment method.
 When savvy industry insiders Steven Boelens and Stefaan Mouradian founded their diamond jewellery brand BAUNAT in 2008, they ripped up the proverbial rule book in the process. 
 Twelve years later, the BAUNAT team prides itself on specialising in 100 per cent natural and conflict-free diamonds, with each stone carefully inspected to ensure its carat, clarity, colour, cut and radiance is of an exceptional standard. 
 Combining traditional jewellery-making methods with innovative technology, local goldsmiths and diamond setters produce each piece in partnership with BAUNAT’s designers, who specialise in timeless silhouettes. 
 Alongside its core collection, which spans gold, platinum and diamond styles, BAUNAT offers a tailor-made service for customers looking to create their dream jewels. 
 Following a consultation with the team, their creation is visualised in 3D form before being produced by BAUNAT’s expert artisans in just three weeks. 
 The secret to BAUNAT’s success, Mouradian says, stems from its digital-first approach. 
 By purchasing diamonds at the source, designing, manufacturing and delivering its own product and operating just a few select showrooms across the world, BAUNAT is able to offer exceptional quality diamond jewellery at a competitive price. 
 Such is BAUNAT’s success that the brand has been able to continue selling throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and adapted quickly to the ‘new normal’. 
 The by-appointment-only boutique will house BAUNAT's latest jewellery and watch collections, as well as offering customers the chance to speak to resident diamond experts and try on pieces that catch their eye. 
 The company’s clients include jewelry brands such as Austria’s Swarovski and Belgium’s BAUNAT, and the multinational electronics and healthcare conglomerate, Philips. 
Wow was I excited to discover Jooki at CES 2018.
 While there is a Jooki companion app (iOS and Android) to let you upload the music, set the volume, or limit the hours kids can use the Jooki player, I like the app is parents-only. 
 Also, the Jooki player is splash-proof but I’m not sure to what degree. 
Find the Jooki music player through the company’s website.
The MP3 player is known as a Jooki and works by using small figurines (and a few buttons) to control the device.
 This means that [Sebastian] was able to use the MQTT messages from the Jooki to do all kinds of things beyond its intended use with openHAB, an open-source home automation system, such as dimming the lights and closing the blinds when he puts his son to bed. 
 The Jooki is a little pricey, but if you happen to have one around, it’s an impressive tool that can go well beyond its original intended use. 
 Remember how hard it was to put on children's songs or an audiobook when you were a young kid?You either had to understand all the buttons on your parents' CD player or else convince them that they really did want to put on that same nursery rhymes CD for the fourth time today.But now, giving a child the power to play his or her own music and audiobooks has never been so easy.To turn on music or stories on the Jooki , a wireless loudspeaker that plays straight from your Spotify account or an SD card, all your child needs to do is put a toy on it.Each included toy can be assigned to basically anything you can play as a sound: a certain playlist or song on Spotify, a folder on the SD card, even a web radio to stream.Undoubtedly the best thing about the Jooki is how easy it is to use – and that's crucial if it's a piece of technology meant to be used by children.In practice, we found children of all ages – even adults – could have fun with it, but it's quite special to see a one-year-old's face when they discover they can put on their own favourite music without help.The WiFi speaker comes with five figurines that can each be assigned to a set playlist on Spotify or a folder in the SD card.Once you've set up the device through the Jooki app or connected the speaker to your WiFi, your kid can start playing with it.One small drawback is the few seconds it takes to boot up once turned on, but children that tried our model were surprisingly happy to accept the short wait.You can also play music straight from an SD card, which certainly gives you more options for audiobooks, which isn't a strongpoint of Spotify.But in the long term, you'll likely find it easier to quickly remove an annoying song through the Spotify app than to change files on an SD card.The build quality is certainly what you'd want for a high-tech children's toy, and the solid plastic design feels like it would survive a fall. 
 The Jooki will certainly continue playing your Spotify playlist for children until you tell it to stop.But since it's all synchronised to the Spotify app on your phone, it's easy to play something else once your child has stopped listening. 
 If your kids are rocking out too noisily, you can manually pre-set a maximum volume in the app.One other small problem is that whenever your child uses the Jooki, he or she is essentially hijacking your Spotify account. 
 This means, for example, if you're streaming some tunes while out for a run, when your child plays some music at home, your music might suddenly stop and be replaced by children's songs.Now we come to the main disadvantage of the Jooki – and it's a big one: the price. 
 The US$200 (RM828) pricetag that comes with a Jooki will probably be the biggest hurdle for parents, especially since cheap speakers cost as little as US$20 (RM83).And yet, despite costing as much as a huge Lego set, the Jooki isn't even the priciest music player for kids out there.For about 20%, you can get the German-made Hoerbert, a less smartphone-friendly alternative. 
 But without Bluetooth you won't be able to wirelessly play music from your smartphone.Another alternative is a getting smart speaker with a digital assistant from Google, Amazon or Apple, but these will require your child to speak well so they can say exactly what song or audiobook they want.Obviously, the sound on a cheap no-name speaker won't compare to the Jooki. 
 But what you're really paying for with the Jooki is a simple, foolproof design.Sure, you could save around three quarters of the price and get a plastic bear that also wirelessly plays music from your phone. 
But your child won't have the same autonomy as with the easy-to-use Jooki.
Jooki is a Wi-Fi speaker for kids.
I checked Jooki out today at CES and found it charming.
And jooki gives parents (and trusted children) the chance to do just that.
 Since the music is stored on jooki, it can go with you anywhere. 
 2 / 5 Jooki : A speaker & companion for children Jooki is a fun speaker that lets children choose what they want to listen to (music, books etc.) while the parent stays in control using the companion app. 
The child simply places the Star on Jooki and the correct playlist will start playing.
The apps lets you set limits - when the kids are allowed to use Jooki and what they listen to.
Jooki - The Best Music Player for Kids and Teens!
 Jooki is a portable screen - free, high - quality music and stories player that can be used by anyone, anywhere! 
 Instead of using a screen, kids use characters in the form of figurines to choose what music is played — enabling Jooki to reduce screen time for the kids while they enjoy their music and stories. 
 3+, $199.99, available at jooki.rocks, Amazon.

 Users can link the Jooki music player’s playlist on a figurine (song, story, album or internet radio station), place it on top of Jooki and let the magic happen.

Maily’s head bobbed out of view like a duck diving for insects.
 Bobbing back up, Maily held the shoes aloft in all their pink-laces-and-velcro-strapped glory. 
 “Next time I go to class without COVID, you’re gonna see me wear them,” said Maily. 
 At the time, neither Maily nor her peers had ever set foot inside Mr. Enna’s classroom. 
 So when Maily showed off her new shoes at the end of a lesson in February, it wasn’t an accident. 
 Back in February, a few minutes after Maily first displayed her sparkly Skechers to the class, she showed them off again. 
 Pointing her camera downward, Maily repeated her promise that her classmates and teacher would see them in-person eventually. 
 He said: “At Tesco I had over 100 let’s talk meetings, over 20 written warnings and four final written warnings, maily falling out with people or saying the wrong thing. 
 This year’s Christmas episode, Have Yourself a Maily Linda Christmas, separates the family for much of the episode, but it keeps together the ingredients that make up an entertaining half hour of Burger-y bliss. 
Have Yourself a Maily Linda Christmas is a solidly entertaining affair that rises to some pretty great jokes every so often.

 Maily is not like any other app out there, it is fun, easy to use and definitely secure in every way. 
4 reasons why Maily is perfect for your kids:
 As it is the Christmas season, in the spirit of giving, Maily could be the best app you could get your kids. 
 Ellie Scotney looked dynamic as she caught Maily Gangloff with sharp uppercuts and hooks, taking a points decision after six rounds. 
 But when an important package goes undelivered, Linda breaks protocol and takes it upon herself to save the day in the   Have Yourself A Maily Linda Christmas   holiday-themed episode of BOBÕS BURGERS airing Sunday, Dec. 15 (9:00-9:30 PM ET/PT) on FOX. 
 In honor of this year’s Christmas episode, “Have Yourself a Maily Linda Christmas,” it’s only right that we show Linda some love. 
 Before we get started, there will be spoilers for the most recent Bob’s Burgers episode, “Have Yourself a Maily Linda Christmas.”

 The third site in Kyrgyzstan is Maily-Suu, where a Soviet-era uranium plant is located. 
 Uranium mining started in Maily-Suu in 1946 and some 10,000 tons of uranium was extracted from the site by 1968. 
Many say the uranium used for the first Soviet nuclear bomb was mined at Maily-Suu.
There are 23 uranium-tailing dumps and 13 rock dumps in the Maily-Suu area.

The fun and fancy-free that youngsters found without limit in the dime stores began the second the doors swung open.
 The lack of interest “changed on the dime” and is likely going to spur a flurry of activity, Tolar said. 
Montréal-based imprint Dime and American skate company Baker Skateboards have joined forces on an apparel and deck collection celebrating their respective histories.
 The collection ushers in two new graphics: one enlisting an oversized, block-like font that reads “Dime Skateboards” and another tapping a vibrant red cursive to spell out both brand names atop a black grid with a rose motif. 
 The first iteration features both logos — “Dime” in large all-caps lettering and “Baker Skateboards” off-center in a smaller, overlayed font — atop a volcanic background. 
The second design boasts an image of a man about to smash a skateboard with “Hugo Balek” in large red text on the left side and the aforementioned “Dime Skateboards” motif on the right.
 The Dime x Baker collection will be available to shop on Dime’s webstore beginning Saturday, June 5 at 1 p.m.

A pattern dime of 1916 which was accidentally circulated.
The Mercury dime is what started this writer collecting coins.
 In the fall of 1950 I lived in Longmont, Colo. and a local grocery store advertised that it would sell a pound of margarine for a dime if that coin was dated 1940. 
It did not take long to discover why the store was so ‘generous:’ this particular dime was very hard to find in that part of the country.
 There is more to the history of the Mercury dime than just being used an as advertisement for merchandise, however. 
 In the first place, although called the ‘Mercury’ dime, it is also sometimes referred to as the Winged Liberty Head dime as the head is of a woman, not a man. 
 However, to the general public and numismatists as well, this coin is called the Mercury dime and probably will be as long as there are collectors of United States coins. 
 In 1892 the Barber dime was introduced and, although not great art, served the nation well for 24 years. 
 Secretary McAdoo, using his legal authority to choose designs, invited a select group of artists to submit sketches for the dime, quarter, and half dollar. 
By early in 1916 matters had progressed to the point that Adolph A. Weinman had been notified that his drawings for the dime had been accepted.
 By the fall of 1916 problems with the dime design had been solved and coinage began at all three mints, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Denver. 
The government was justifiably proud of the three new designs for the minor silver coinage and in the Mint Report for 1916 we find the following description for the dime: the obverse “shows a head of Liberty with winged cap.
 Because of low demand, the coinage of new dimes at Denver was very light, with only 264,000 pieces struck. 
The other 1916 Mercury dimes are more reasonable in value.
 Although the 1916–D dime has always been a difficult piece to obtain, in the early 1950s these could still be found in circulation on rare occasion. 
 Dime coinage in 1917 was extremely heavy due to the war, which broke out in April between the United States and Germany. 
 More people working required additional small change for ordinary commercial purposes and the dime was a key coin in those transactions, just as the quarter dollar is today. 
 With war’s end in 1918, the economy began to slow down, but in 1919 was yet strong enough for a heavy mintage of dimes at all three mints. 
Oddly enough this trend continued well into 1920 but towards the end of that year dime coinage had virtually come to a standstill.
1921 has long been known as a scarce date in the Mercury dime series.
The lack of demand was not the only reason for low dime coinage in 1921 and none at all in 1922.
 Dime coinage resumed at a reasonable level in 1923, again with only two mints but San Francisco replaced Denver in this instance. 
Occasionally one sees notice of a 1923–D dime but these are contemporary counterfeits.
 Beginning in 1924 the coinage of dimes became much stronger and it is only the occasional issue, such as the 1926–S, which is slightly difficult to obtain. 
 With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929–1930, the coinage of dimes showed a marked decline as spending declined dramatically. 
There was no coinage of the dime in 1932 or 1933 due to lack of public demand.
 Oddly enough, the 1.8 million dimes struck at San Francisco in 1931 would have been higher except for a curious directive from the Bureau of the Mint in November of that year. 
 Having discovered that only 194,000 nickels had been struck to date, the Bureau ordered that dime coinage cease and this mint concentrate on the nickel instead. 
This 1938 Mercury dime illustrates the last year of peace before the start of World War II in 1939.
 By 1934 the economy had recovered sufficiently so that dime coinage was again strong, but San Francisco did not resume mintage until 1935. 
For the years of 1934 through 1945 virtually any dime is readily obtainable in high grade with the exception of the two overdates (1942/1 at both Philadelphia and Denver).
In the 1950s one of the ‘key’ varieties for the Mercury dime was the 1945–S with ‘micro’ S.
Until 1942 the Philadelphia Mint regularly struck proof Mercury dimes for collectors.
 The last Mercury dimes were coined in 1945; at the beginning of 1946 they were replaced by the Roosevelt dime, which is still with us.

 That sums up Design on a Dime, the annual benefit founded by designer James Huniford in 2004 to benefit Housing Works, a nonprofit that helps people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. 
 But this week, Design on a Dime is making its comeback with a scaled-down event held in three of Housing Works’ retail locations in SoHo and Gramercy Park. 
 This year to mark Housing Works’ 30th anniversary, Design on a Dime has a new feature: “30 Chairs for 30 Years,” an online auction with Chairish featuring chairs by designers including Danielle Colding, Brad Ford, Alfredo Paredes, and Cliff Fong.

STEVENS POINT – The Dime and Dollar Thrift Store in Stevens Point will soon relocate to Wisconsin Rapids.
 “We are on the move and are soon to close our doors there and relocate to Wisconsin Rapids,” said Jan Peronto, current manager of the Dime and Dollar Thrift Store in Stevens Point. 
“Dime and Dollar is a non-profit organization that started about 34 years ago and currently has a store in Wausau as well.
 Believe it or not, some of the most valuable dimes are worth more than $1 million. 
But what makes some dimes worth seven figures while others are worth just the “TEN CENTS” face value stamped on the coin?
The delineation between rare dimes and common ones may not always be apparent at first glance.
 Let’s review some of the most valuable dimes in the list below, along with an explanation of why each is worth more than face value: 
1796 and 1797 Draped Bust Dimes
 The dime was first struck in 1796, representing an early period in United States Mint federal coin production. 
The 1796 Draped Bust dime is extremely valuable.
 A 1796 dime is worth about $2,600 even in the heavily worn grade of Good-4. 
 Dimes from the following year of 1797 also saw similarly low mintage figures and are worth $2,500 and up. 
Carson City Liberty Seated Dimes from the 1870s
Tthe Carson City Seated Liberty dimes struck from 1871 through 1874 are exceedingly rare.
 The most valuable of these dimes is the 1873-CC, which saw a mintage of 12,400 pieces and offers collectors just one known survivor today. 
 In one of its more recent trades, the 1873-CC dime in mint condition fetched $1,840,000! 
 1894-S Barber dime, also known as a Liberty Head dime 
Here’s a valuable dime with a story.
 So, San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett reportedly had a tiny sum of 24 proof dimes bearing the 1894 date, and “S” mintmark, struck to balance the books. 
He then gave many of these 1894-S Barber dimes to his close friends and associates.
 Only nine 1894-S proof Barber dimes are accounted for today, and all realize more than $1 million when they cross the auction block today. 
The 1916-D Mercury dime is just about as famous a rarity as the 1909-S VDB Lincoln cent.
 Only 484,000 examples of the 1916-D Mercury dime were made, and just a fraction of those exist today—hardly enough to meet collector demand. 
 While many people dream of landing a 1916-D Mercury dime in circulation, this has unfortunately always been a difficult piece to find in pocket change. 
1942/1 and 1942/1-D Overdate Mercury Dimes
These scarce overdate varieties are two of the most sought-after dimes from the 20th century.
The 1975 No-S proof Roosevelt dime is one of the most valuable of all modern coins.
 Any 1975 dimes found in pocket change without a mintmark are from the Philadelphia Mint, which did not place mintmarks on dimes at that time. 
The Philadelphia Mint began applying mintmarks to dimes in 1980.
 Many of these 1982 no-mintmark dimes were shipped to Ohio, and possibly thousands were distributed as change at the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. 
The 1982 no-mintmark dime is a considerably scarce variety.
Likely tens of thousands were minted—a small percentage of the 519.4 million 1982 Roosevelt dimes the Philadelphia Mint produced that year.
The 1982 no-mintmark dime with a weak strike is worth about $55 in typical uncirculated grades.
 In addition to the most valuable dimes listed above, there are others you should keep an eye out for. 
 Barber and Mercury dimes – We’re mainly focusing on the super-valuable dimes in this article, but that’s not to suggest those not listed here aren’t worth keeping. 
 That’s so with Barber and Mercury dimes, all of which are worth at least $2 and up in worn condition. 
 Wakati, which means   time   in Swahili, is a hair care brand for natural, textured hair. 
 When the creators behind Wakati began development on the hair care brand several years ago, they sought to launch a   transformational   collection, says Kenya Foy of the brand's marketing team. 
The goal: for Wakati — a part of the Kao USA Inc.
Wakati product line Wakati's line of products (photo: brand)
   Our CFO, a FAMU alumni, reached out to some contacts there to see if some of their students would like to collaborate with us on this product,   explains Foy, adding that their newfound teammates   were brought in pretty early on in the process and were involved in many aspects of developing Wakati, from packaging design insights, marketing plans and distribution guidance to gaining product feedback.   
 Wakati and FAMU   worked together to tackle consumer challenges and develop brand elements that would ultimately help birth it,   Foy says. 
 My team placed first, which ultimately led to me working as the Marketing Intern on the Wakati brand during the summer of 2019.   
I also felt like one of the most important selling points was Wakati's partnership with FAMU.
 Fryer:   The man behind the camera for our first Wakati photo shoot is a FAMU graduate, Stephon Williams. 
 That being said, I wanted Wakati to have [digital] content that both eased the mind of the consumer (because the product was new and not well-known) and showed results.   
 Fryer:   As a woman of color with natural hair and an HBCU student, Wakati's partnership with FAMU is special to me. 
 FAMU, and more specifically SBI, played a significant role in Wakati's creative process.   
Wakati is the first brand of its kind to partner with an HBCU.
 There is so much untapped talent at HBCUs, and Wakati is doing its best to uncover it through its influencer and student ambassador programs.   
PEOPLE: What message do you hope consumers take away from the Wakati line?
 Fryer:   My favorite product in the line is the Wakati Oil-Infused Cream. 
 Fryer:   I've been blessed enough to see Wakati from its early stages of development to being on the shelf at both Walgreens and Target. 
 Born out of the research and development team at Kao USA, known for the iconic Jergens®, Bioré® and John Frieda® brands, the patented Wakati Water-Activated Advanced Conditioner formula, the first product in the collection, was created to give women the power to finger-comb detangle, soften coarse hair, and help to reduce shedding. 
   We knew we had a stellar formula, one that would deliver against the needs of modern women who embrace the natural hair movement,   says Kenya Foy, U.S. Marketing, Wakati. 
The Wakati line features four products:
 Wakati Water-Activated Advanced Conditioner - ( $11.99; 8oz / $18.99; 16oz) - The Wakati Conditioner is activated by water, traveling natural hair's kinks, coils and curls, depositing moisture along the way. 
Wakati Sulfate-Free Shampoo - ($11.99) - The Wakati Sulfate-Free Shampoo delivers balanced cleansing to gently remove build-up while prepping your hair for optimal conditioning.
Wakati Oil-Infused Cream - ($11.99) - The Wakati Oil-Infused Cream seals in the right touch of moisture for slip and added shine.
Wakati Re-Activating Conditioning Mist - ($11.99) - The Wakati Re-Activating Conditioning Mist hydrates and refreshes curls for a smooth finish with added shine.
 With the Wakati range, natural hair is overall more manageable, so naturalistas can spend less time styling and more time enjoying their kinks, curls and coils. 
This first of its kind partnership for Kao USA proved invaluable to the creation of the Wakati brand.
 Wakati is more than just a line up of hair products, but a brand that truly stands for its consumers and understands how special the natural, textured hair consumer is. 
 Wakati, meaning   time   in Swahili, represents how generation after generation has used natural hair to connect with their ancestry, showing how the beauty of Black culture can be represented through hair. 
Wakati Hair Care launched in November 2019 on Kao USA's first direct-to-consumer site wakatihair.com.
 Wakati was developed to answer one question, “Why are there not more effective hair care formulas specifically designed for natural, Black hair?” 
 The Kao team has teamed up with various Historically Black Colleges and Universities to create Wakati (Swahili for   time  ), a new hair care brand that's designed for people with natural hair textures. 
 Wakati, the latest offering but first line catered to Black beauty buyers from Kao Corp., launched four products in January: a Water Activated Advanced Conditioner ($11.99 for 8 oz., $18.99 for 16 oz.), a Sulfate-Free Shampoo ($11.99), the Oil-Infused Cream ($11.99) and the Re-Activating Conditioning Mist ($11.99). 
 “We knew we had a stellar formula, one that would deliver against the needs of modern women who embrace the natural hair movement,” says Kenya Foy, U.S. Marketing for Wakati. 
 We talked with Foy to learn more about Wakati, the process to create it, and asked point blank period what makes it so special. 
 Eight years ago when the concept for Wakati was being worked on, there were a lot less hair lines on the market dedicated to 4C hair. 
What would you say sets Wakati apart?
What sets Wakati apart is a similar philosophy to all the brands that fall under the Kao USA umbrella – the mission to be closest to our consumers is our number one priority.
 In February, Kao USA launched its first hair-care line for natural and curly textured hair called Wakati. 
   Huu ni wakati wa kuomboleza, kusimama na kushikamana kama watanzania. 
 Ni wakati wa kuzika tofauti zetu na kuwa wamoja kama taifa, ni wakati wa kufarijiana na kuonyesha upendo, kudumisha amani na kuenzi utu, uzalendo na utanzania wetu,   she said. 
   Huu si wakati wa kutazama mbele kwa shaka bali kutazama mbele kwa matumaini na kujiamini. 
 Si wakati wa kutazama yaliyo pita bali kutazam yajayo,   she said. 
 She added,   Sio wakati wa kunyosheana vidole bali kushikana mikono na kusonga mbele tukifarijiana ili kujenga taifa ambalo kiongozi wetu shupavu alikusudia  . 
The Belgian-made Wakati is a small tent powered by a solar panel and one liter of water per week.
 Instead of cooling, the Wakati creates a protective microclimate in the tent that can extend the life of 200 kilograms of fruits and vegetables to up to 10 days. 
 Wakati has distributed its technology in Haiti, Afghanistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. 
 A pilot project distributed the first 100 Wakatis for free, and after that, they have cost US$100. 
 In the Nakivale Settlement in the south-west of Uganda, the Wakati Foundation (meaning “passing of time” in Swahili) has been sewing masks and distributing them to the community.

 In some countries where the climate is fairly warm, that can be a daunting, if not almost impossible task, but the Wakati might be an ideal solution. 
 The Wakati can extends the life of produce significantly without the need for a refrigerator, so farmers can sell intact goods and consumers can reap the benefits of eating fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Extending the life of produce with the Wakati reduces waste and increases potential profits for farmers.
 The singer, producer, instrumentalist, and vocalist returns to the charts with this new song titled ‘Sweet Wakati’. 
Sweet Wakati if translated means a Lollipop and Aziz sings about how sweet his woman is.

Wado Ichimonji is Zoro’s first real katana.
 Before he obtained it, Wado Ichimonji belonged to Kuina, the daughter Koushirou, the master of the dojo, where Zoro developed his swordsmanship.

 Key Players covering This Report: – Plum Voice, Nexmo (Vonage), Vidyo (Enghouse Systems), Sonar, Mitel, MessageBird, Voxbone, Infobip, Bandwidth, Alcatel Lucent Enterprise (ALE), Pontaltech, Wavy, Plivo, RingCentral. 
 Voxbone, which Bandwidth had acquired in November of last year for $520 million, also added to the sharp increase in active customer accounts. 
 Voxbone, which provides telecom application programming interface (API) solutions, had brought 700 customer accounts into Bandwidth's fold. 
 Voxbone accounted for $21 million of Bandwidth's $100 million in CPaaS revenue during the quarter, which wasn't surprising. 
Bandwidth used Voxbone's legacy platform to source mobile numbers and integrated them with its own messaging API.
So the acquisition of Voxbone is paying off handsomely for Bandwidth and lifting its sales and earnings substantially.
 Additionally, Bandwidth points out that Voxbone sports a superior margin profile. 
 Mordor Intelligence estimates that the telecom API market could grow at an annual rate of over 17% through 2026, indicating that Voxbone can keep delivering strong growth for Bandwidth in the long run. 
 What's more, it is worth noting that the metric wasn't impacted by the Voxbone acquisition, indicating that Bandwidth recorded strong organic growth in customer spending. 
 However, Bandwidth can do better and drive additional customer spending thanks to the Voxbone acquisition and the strong organic growth that it is witnessing.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Never has the adage that quality is king been more true than with today's rollout of global Communications-as-a-Service leader Voxbone's new call quality performance platform.
 Voxbone Insights shakes up the market for business voice services by providing enterprises, business VoIP platforms, and SaaS product managers with full visibility into call performance across both the customer and carrier legs of the call. 
 But Voxbone Insights is available entirely from the cloud, via the Voxbone platform and API. 
 Matt Brown, Voxbone VP Product Management, said:   The business voice market is now so competitive that quality and customer experience have become major differentiators.   
   With Voxbone Insights, we stay true to our mission of simplifying the provision and management of telephony services via our cloud-native Enterprise communications platform. 
 Voxbone Insights is available for all users, eliminating much of the cost and complexity that comes with a traditional service management layer.   
   At Voxbone, we take pride in the quality of our enterprise-grade network, so it makes sense for us to make our quality metrics visible to every customer for every call, in real-time. 
All Voxbone customers are entitled to quality-enriched data on their 500 most recent calls.
 Voxbone is an international enterprise cloud communications leader, with coverage across 93% of the world by GDP.

 Voxbone has approximately 200 employees located in Brussels, London, Romania, Singapore, and the United States. 
Bandwidth cloud company buys Voxbone for €446m

 Morken said: “Voxbone’s platform is trusted by approximately 900 enterprises, including brands like Uber, Zoom, 8x8 and Skype. 
 Not having end-to-end visibility is problematic, which is one of the primary issues we’re looking to solve with the launch of Voxbone Insights , our new call quality and performance platform. 
 With Voxbone Insights, customers get full real-time visibility into all their calls in and out of Voxbone’s global network. 
 At its heart is a collection of Call Detail Records (CDRs), for all inbound and outbound Voxbone calls, enriched with granular quality metrics. 
 But the real magic is that these metrics cover the whole call journey, providing you the ability to drill into the numbers and understand how calls perform 1) across the carrier leg, as they pass through the Voxbone network and any upstream providers; and 2) during the customer leg, as they cross from our network to yours.

Workday shares were higher after it closed the $700 million purchase of Peakon and a key analyst affirmed an overweight rating on the stock.
Workday (WDAY) - Get Report shares were higher on Tuesday after the company said it closed the acquisition of Peakon and analysts at J.P.
 Murphy expects the acquisition of Peakon, an employee-success platform that converts feedback into actionable data, to place it in competition with a market that has been dominated by SAP (SAP) - Get Report and Oracle (ORCL) - Get Report. 
 Workday said in January that it would acquire Peakon, Copenhagen, for $700 million cash. 
 “I see great opportunity in working together   with Peakon   to provide customers with the tools and insights they need to support employees and build stronger workplaces,   Workday Vice Chairman Tom Bogan said in a statement. 
   Six years ago, we founded Peakon on the belief that an organization’s most valuable assets are its people, and that people do their best work when they feel heard and supported at work,” said Phil Chambers, co-founder and CEO of Peakon. 
 The firm has also seen eleven portfolio exits since January 2020, including Digital Surgery’s acquisition by Medtronic, Peakon’s acquisition by Workday and Depop’s acquisition by Etsy. 
 Previous exited investments include Betfair (FTSE: BET), Depop (Etsy), Digital Surgery (Medtronic), Frontier Car Group (OLX Group), Magic Pony (Twitter), NaturalMotion (Zynga), Peakon (Workday), Recorded Future (Insight Partners), Sunrise (Microsoft), Talend (NASDAQ: TLND) and Yoox Net-a-Porter (BIT: YNAP). 
Workday acquires employee experience platform Peakon
Workday is handing over US$700 million (AU$915.5 million) in cash to acquire employee experience monitoring platform Peakon.
 The Peakon acquisition will enable Workday to offer a service for organisations that can learn about and discover employee feelings, behaviours, and requirements. 
 The combination will merge intelligent technology from Peakon that determines and distributes surveys and information to the right person at the right time, 
 Workday cofounder and co-CEO Aneel Bhusri says, “Peakon is on the cutting edge of helping organisations turn employee insights into more connected teams and stronger organisations.” 
 Peakon cofounder and CEO Phil Chambers is equally positive about the acquisition, saying that the company will be able to help every employee ‘drive the change they want to see’. 
 Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Workday will acquire Peakon for consideration of approximately $700 million in cash, subject to adjustments. 
 Peakon has worked with customers including Capgemini, The Adecco Group, and Staples. 
 Peakon and its shareholders’ legal advisors are Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Osborne Clarke, and Highbridge. 
 Peakon, the Denmark headquartered “employee retention platform,” has raised a further $35 million in funding. 
 Originally offering “people analytics” by enabling companies to more regularly survey employees, Peakon has since evolved to become a fully fledged SaaS for employee retention. 
 They are employee engagement, actionable insights to prevent employee problems before they arise, and competitor analysis through benchmarking employee engagement data against Peakon’s proprietary industry-wide data. 
 Peakon’s surveys are designed to be both fast and conducted weekly, rather than annually (as is the traditional way of surveying employees). 
 For example, Peakon claims to be able to predict when certain employees are in danger of leaving 250 days in advance of doing so. 
 Zooming out further, Peakon’s use of standardised questions for the micro surveys it conducts on behalf of customers is enabling the company to build what it claims to be the largest real-time database of “how the world’s workforce is feeling”. 
 Meanwhile, I’m told Peakon has grown extremely fast over the last year. 
 Peakon also has offices in U.K., Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand, and says current headcount sits at over 180. 
 Since launching in early 2016, Peakon’s customers have included the likes of Capgemini, Verizon, BMW, TrustPilot, Harrods and easyJet. 
 We were blown away by Peakon’s rigorous, data-driven approach to this problem”.

 The study found that, by using Peakon, the composite organization financially benefited in the following ways: 
 Estimated savings of $755,000 as a result of reduced employee absenteeism, with average absenteeism declining by two days after the first year with Peakon.

 Savings of around $5,200 as HR teams save seven days annually on post-survey analysis: Peakon survey results are delivered directly to managers instead. 
 When interviewed for the study, one enterprise customer from the recruitment sector said:   The Peakon platform drives engagement results to managers directly through the dashboard. 
Peakon customers interviewed for the study repeatedly stated that their EX scores improved following the implementation.

   As this study shows, Peakon customers enjoy benefits that extend far beyond improved employee engagement scores. 
 We believe that this study by Forrester Consulting just proves it further by quantifying the impact Peakon can have on businesses worldwide.   
FinTech Pleo has announced the appointment of Arun Mani as its Chief Revenue Officer.

 Jeppe Rindom, Co-founder and CEO of Pleo, said, “We are delighted to welcome Arun to the executive leadership team and he will play a crucial role in guiding Pleo’s growth over the coming months. 
 Arun brings invaluable experience to Pleo, most recently from building the Freshworks organisation in Europe and prior to that, heading sales in the Americas for AppNexus – two impressive, international, multi-unicorn software businesses. 
 Arun intimately understands what it takes to scale a business across Europe, and with his expertise I am confident that Pleo is well on its way to reaching unicorn status imminently.”

 There is a strong market need and product fit for a solution like Pleo, and I’m excited to further expand its proposition to become the go-to solution for businesses everywhere. 
 In my role, I’ll have a personal goal of ensuring that Pleo has 1 million engaged users by the end of 2025, which is a 25 times increase from now until the end of 2025. 
 With the rate that Pleo’s customer-base is growing, and the engagement it has built so far – I’m confident that this goal will become a reality.” 
 Fintech scale-up Pleo, which offers simplified expense and bill management automation tools, and smart company Mastercards, has appointed Arun Mani as its Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). 
 As CRO, Mani will be helping to support Pleo’s growth in the coming years, overseeing all revenue-facing operations across sales, customer experience, marketing and partnerships across Pleo’s seven markets - in the UK & Ireland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Spain.

 Pleo was also recently named as Global Startup of the Year 2021, and is listed by GP Bullhound as having an 84% chance to reach unicorn status within two-three years. 
 We asked experts, including Johansson, Jeppe Rindom, CEO of company spending startup Pleo and Oscar Hyléen, head of communications at challenger bank Rocker, for their top tips. 
 But it’s important to stick to a customer-led strategy, says Jeppe Rindom, CEO of Pleo, which issues company cards also powered by Enfuce. 
Pleo found its niche by offering a solution which alleviates painful company expense systems.
 Similarly, Rindom says there are areas Pleo can’t yet support: ”This has seen us integrate with accounting software, such as Xero and digital receipt business Flux, to complement our offering.” 
 Enfuce has published their guide on launching a winning payment card, including use cases of both Pleo and Rocker. 
 Late-stage fintech startup Pleo, which offers expense management tools and “smart” company Mastercards, says it plans to raise a Series C round of funding this summer. 
Pleo has raised $78.8 million to date.
 Pleo is today launching Bills, a platform to consolidate, track and pay business-to-business bill payments and a supplier’s terms of service. 
Bills are automatically processed using Pleo’s OCR technology and cross-referenced for duplication and validated for authenticity before being approved for payment.
 Pleo was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by Rindom and Niccolo Perra, who were early team members Tradeshift.

Business expense solution provider Pleo has added Google Pay to its functionality as of today.
 “As an Android user, I am particularly thrilled to be releasing this new functionality to our customer base,” said Niccolo Perrera, co-founder and CTO of Pleo. 
 “Following on from our Apple Pay announcement this year, the integration of Google Pay means that the Pleo service can be used seamlessly by up to 90 per cent of all our customers.” 
“This is a huge step forward and marks another milestone in the movement towards Pleo becoming a fully-digitised business spending solution.
 In short, it’s never been easier to pay with Pleo.” 
 Pleo only added Apple Pay to the list of its capabilities back in September, rolling out the feature across Europe. 
Pleo also announced a big strategy shift at the very start of the year.
Pleo offers company cards for employees combined with smart expense reporting to help managers and owners oversee spending.
 In last week’s Sifted Talks, we asked this and more to our panel of personal finance, HR and business spend experts, including: Anne-Marie Headley, CEO and founder of HR and people solutions business Workforce Buddy; Clare Seal, author and campaigner with The Financial Wellbeing Forum; and Sara Brooks, VP of sales at company card provider Pleo. 
And it’s not just Seal — a Pleo and YouGov survey found that as many as 57% of young workers in the UK have experienced stress due to unpaid expenses.
 Services such as Pleo allow everyone access to a company card: businesses can skip the expenses system, giving junior employees limited but real-time access to company funds. 
 “Salaries and transparency around salaries is always difficult… At Pleo we really believe in transparency, this is what we build, this is what we sell… I’m striving as much as possible to have a model where employees can earn more or less based on their performance, but make that really clear.”

Business banking provider Pleo has integrated Apple Pay into its offering for its UK and European customers.
It will mean Pleo customers can sync their Pleo business cards with Apple Pay to make business purchases on the go.
 Pleo, which was founded in 2015 in Copenhagen, says it has over 10,000 customers in Europe and believes Apple’s mobile payment method, particularly its security and privacy features, will be a hit with its customers. 
 Nicollo Perrera, Pleo co-founder, said: “We are thrilled to announce this new functionality with Apple Pay. 
 Not only does this make the Pleo service more seamless for our customer base, but continues a trend of people expecting the services they have in their private lives being mirrored in their professional ones.   
 In January, Pleo announced a big strategy shift, ditching prepaid spending cards in exchange for credit cards. 
Pleo had previously offered company cards for employees combined with smart expense reporting to help managers and owners oversee spending.

 Fintech scale-up Pleo, which offers simplified expense management tools and smart company Mastercards, today launches Bills - an easy way to consolidate, track and pay business-to-business (B2B) bill payments and a supplier’s terms of service. 
 With free-of-charge domestic transfers, businesses will also benefit from additional, vital cost-savings when paying invoices using Pleo Bills. 
 Employees forward invoices to a dedicated Pleo Bills email address, with the documents then automatically processed using Pleo’s OCR technology. 
Each bill is cross-referenced for duplication and validated for authenticity before being approved for payment - all via the Pleo platform.
 Pleo’s recent customer survey found that, despite 30% of businesses admitting to paying invoices late at least once a year, 55% of admins still process and pay invoices manually - leaving room for human error and a lack of transparency. 
 Jeppe Rindom, Co-founder and CEO of Pleo, says: 
 “Since the Pandemic hit, Pleo has accelerated its product pipeline to activate vital financial technology features in its journey to become a central hub for companies to manage cash flow - and Bills is an example of this. 
Pleo is a fundamentally new way to manage business spending.
 Powered by a smart company card, and linked app, Pleo uses automation to take the stress and friction out of expenses – a process that is still largely paper-based across the UK and Europe. 
 At the same time, managers keep on top of company expenditure, with a real-time overview of spending on Pleo cards, the ability to set individual spending limits, and integration with accounting tools such as Xero. 
 Pleo aims to empower employees, giving them the autonomy to make company purchases with their Pleo card and removing the need to submit tedious expense reports – all whilst helping managers and financial directors to save time and invest it in more strategic endeavours. 
 With Pleo, the same data shows these businesses are now reclaiming 11.5 hours a month previously lost to expenses – that’s a few strategy meetings back on your plate! 
 Later in my career, I worked as the CFO of a fintech start-up business alongside my then colleague, and now Pleo Co-founder Niccollo Perra. 
 After seeing how employees felt empowered when given responsibility for spending, we wanted to build a platform that would set employees up for success without sacrificing control, transparency or financial safety – the result was Pleo. 
This fed into how I hired for and grew Pleo.
 For example, in the early stages of Pleo’s inception, I’d often invite various team members into investor meetings. 
 Pleo is now 250 strong and operating in six European markets, and while I can’t invite everyone into investor meetings anymore, I’m always looking for ways to bring people on the Pleo journey. 
What can we hope to see from Pleo in the future?
 We’ve always built customer-centricity into the heart of everything Pleo does, so our immediate priorities have understandably been focused on supporting our customers and the businesses who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. 
We’ve even made Pleo free for new customers until April 1st to give them transparency over their spending and time back to focus on the important things.
 Looking ahead, I’m excited to see where Pleo’s journey takes us next. 
 In 2020, our software business grew 150% and we also doubled our customer base to over 13,000 businesses using Pleo. 
 Not a day goes by that we don’t receive an inquiry from an investor, and at our current rate of growth, I’m confident Pleo will reach unicorn status in the next one to two years. 
 It can be difficult to know where to start, but according to Jeppe Rindom, CEO and cofounder of Pleo, a software solution that automates company spending, the first step is to acknowledge where your business has made mistakes. 
 In fact, a recent Pleo survey found that employees spend on average 11.5 hours per month manually processing expenses. 
 “You burn so much time,” says Victoria Cozens, company director of Perky Blenders, a specialty coffee roasters who used manual processes before Pleo. 
 “There’s a lot of people involved at different stages of the bill’s lifecycle,” says Loui Funding, one of Pleo’s product managers. 
 To solve this, he suggests utilising a holistic solution such as Pleo Bills, a feature which is integrated with accounting software Xero to document the full lifecycle of a bill, instead of just one section. 
 For example, when looking to automate with Pleo, employee benefits app Cobee wanted to get rid of the hassle of its employees paying expenses with their own money, while esports association Ninjas in Pyjamas wanted to streamline the costs of its merchandising. 
Supercharge your team with Pleo Bills.

 By shifting from prepaid cards to credit cards, Pleo is narrowing its competition. 
Image source: Pleo Co-Founders Jeppe Rindom and Niccolo Perra.
 Business banking provider Pleo announced a dramatic shift today, ditching prepaid spending cards in exchange for credit cards. 
To-date Pleo has offered company cards for employees combined with smart expense reporting to help managers and owners oversee spending.
 Shifting to credit cards puts Pleo in a different category from its current rivals like Soldo or even Tide, which behind their shiny apps don’t actually extend credit to their customers. 
 Now Pleo’s offering is becoming far more akin to Brex in the US, or a corporate card from American Express. 
 The news today comes after Pleo raised $56m last May, Denmark’s largest Series B round at the time, to expand beyond its current markets of Denmark, Ireland, Spain, the UK, Sweden and Germany. 
 Shifting its business towards credit cards will let Pleo launch that expansion, with the startup launching in Spain and Ireland this year with an additional two unnamed markets by the end of the year. 
 Separately, Pleo, the fintech empowering businesses with a smart spending and expense management solution, today announces Google Pay functionality for its 13,000+ European and UK customers.

 Engage ensures Templafy’s platform enables business content not just in the creation and editing phases, but throughout the entirety of the business content lifecycle, ultimately leading to better business results.”

 Revenues to the state's General and School Aid funds in May topped the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference forecast for the month by an astonishing $1 billion as the impact of federal aid through the American Rescue Plan continues to swell available funds, the House Fiscal Agency said Thursday. 
 The tax deadline was moved from April 15 to mid-May this year, but forecasters knew that would change the usual revenue to the state when they met for the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference. 
For revenues to exceed the forecast in a single month by as much as $1 billion is unheard of.
 Even more remarkable is that the forecasting differential occurred in the month of the actual revenue conference, when the forecast is usually at its most accurate. 
 Wildfire experts and climate forecasters are predicting a particularly dry summer ahead, which could lead to an especially bad wildfire season. 
 A forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center predicted that drought will worsen in areas where it has already taken hold on the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and Lanai through September due to below-normal rainfall. 
 By midsummer, new areas of drought are expected to develop in leeward Oahu and Kauai, according to the NOAA forecast.

 Since then, Rizzo said there’s been improvements in forecasting technology and a notable change this year to storm naming. 
 As for storm modeling, Rizzo said there’s been some improvements this year between upgrades to the global forecasting system and more layers of improved physics for data collection. 
 “This allows for improved hurricane formation forecasting with longer lead times to see systems further in advance,” he said. 
 “We also have faster computers that can run more complex forecast models, which would lead to improved forecasts of developing hurricanes.” 
 Forecast models include the American, European and Canadian models, among others. 
 “We work with the National Hurricane Center, and they review all the model output to produce the best possible forecast. 
 It’s the Hurricane Center’s job to review those models, and that input is used to produce the official forecast and the cone. 
What’s the best online source for storm forecasts?
 “It takes you directly to National Hurricane Center’s forecast,” he said. 
The National Weather Service also shares the latest forecast on Facebook and Twitter @NWSKeyWest — for those tracking a storm on their phone while standing in line at Publix to buy bottled water.
The forecast was unchanged for a second consecutive month.
 The report's forecast comes despite a slower-than-expected recovery in the first half of this year and as it warns of   significant uncertainties   such as the potential emergence of new variants of the coronavirus.

 U.S. crude oil production is expected to fall by 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.08 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday, a smaller decline than its forecast last month for a drop of 290,000 bpd. 
   Because prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil remain above $60 per barrel during 2021 in the current forecast, we expect that producers will drill and complete enough wells to raise 2022 production from 2021 levels,   the EIA said. 
 In 2022, production is expected to average 11.8 million bpd, up from a forecast average of 11.1 million bpd in 2021. 
 The agency said it expects U.S. petroleum and other liquid fuel consumption to rise 1.49 million bpd to 19.61 million bpd in 2021, compared with a previous forecast for a rise of 1.39 million bpd. 
 Overall in 2022, U.S. demand is forecast to rise by 1 million bpd to 20.61 million bpd, compared to the EIA's previous forecast for a rise of 1.02 million earlier. 
 For 2022, the agency forecasts that global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will increase by 3.6 million bpd to average 101.3 million bpd.

 Xero said Thursday it’s acquiring Planday, a provider of workday management software, for up to €183.5 million ($219.7 million), expanding the cloud accounting software maker’s employee-scheduling abilities. 
 Planday, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, has more than 350,000 employee users across Europe and the U.K. who use the system for employee scheduling, while enabling businesses to forecast and manage labor costs. 
 Adding Planday’s 350,000 users will expand that footprint substantially. 
 “The acquisition of Planday aligns with our purpose to make life better for people in small businesses and their advisors,” Xero CEO Steve Vamos said in a statement. 
“Planday’s workforce management platform helps small businesses to respond to the rapidly changing nature of work.
Planday also addresses the growing need for flexibility and rising compliance demands within the workplace.”
 The deal is structured in a way that Planday will receive an upfront payment of €155.7 million ($186.4 million) and a subsequent earnout payment of up to €27.8 million ($33.3 million), depending upon several product development and revenue milestones. 
 Thus, the total potential acquisition price for Planday is up to €183.5 million ($219.7 million). 
 “We’re looking forward to working within the Xero family to build a strong launchpad for businesses and employees to manage their time and reach their joint potential in life and in business,” Planday CEO Christian Brøndum wrote in a blog post . “We will continue to operate our ecosystem and partnerships freely. 
 Planday already integrates with Xero through its app marketplace in the U.K., as well as other accounting solutions and third-party workforce-related apps, to deliver a real-time view of staffing needs and payroll costs, alongside key business performance metrics.” 
Planday has been a Xero partner since 2019.
 Xero Limited has announced the acquisition of Planday, a workforce management platform that simplifies employee scheduling; allowing businesses to forecast and better manage their labour costs. 
 Strategically aligned with Xero’s intention to expand the small business platform, the acquisition of Planday will help more small businesses save time and money, support more flexible forms of work and deal with increasing compliance requirements, all in order to look after their people. 
 Planday is an open platform that integrates with accounting solutions, including Xero, and third-party workforce-related apps, to deliver a real-time view of staffing needs and payroll costs, alongside key business performance metrics. 
 When combined with an accounting solution, such as Xero, Planday is able to provide insights to a business or its advisor that help them to adjust staffing levels to match trading conditions and control labour costs, which often poses as an employer’s largest expense. 
Xero CEO Steve Vamos said of the acquisition: “The takeover of Planday aligns with our purpose to make life better for people in small businesses and their advisors.
Planday also addresses the growing need for flexibility and rising compliance demands within the workplace.”
Planday’s cloud-based technology offers significant flexibility and self-service functionality through a mobile app.
 Following the acquisition, Planday will expand its presence into other markets where Xero operates, supporting Xero’s long-term growth plans. 
 With an upfront payment of €155.7 million and a subsequent earnout payment of up to €27.8 million based on product development and revenue milestones, the total potential consideration for the acquisition of Planday is €183.5 million. 
Planday CEO Christian Brøndum added: “We are beyond excited for this next step in Planday’s journey.
Xero has announced it will buy out Denmark-based workforce management platform Planday in a move to further grow its position in the small business market.
 Planday is cloud-based platform that's been designed to provide businesses with a real-time view of staffing needs and payroll costs, alongside business performance metrics. 
   The acquisition of Planday aligns with our purpose to make life better for people in small businesses and their advisors,   Xero CEO Steve Vamos said. 
   Planday's workforce management platform helps small businesses to respond to the rapidly changing nature of work. 
 Planday also addresses the growing need for flexibility and rising compliance demands within the workplace.   
 Following the acquisition, which is expected to be completed in Q1, Xero said Planday will expand its presence into other markets where Xero operates. 
 Planday currently operates in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Germany, and France, and has over 350,000 employee users. 
 During the 12 months, Xero also acquired Australian invoice lending platform Waddle for AU$80 million, Denmark-based workforce management platform Planday for €183.5 million in a move to further grow its position in the small business market, and Sweden-based e-invoicing infrastructure business Tickstar for SEK150 million. 
 Planday, the workforce collaboration platform for shift workers, has raised €35 million in new funding. 
This will also include establishing a U.K.-based technology development hub — which represents a major market for Planday — as well as to grow sales and customer support teams in its London office.
 Founded in 2013, Planday has developed a flexible rota scheduling platform that is used by businesses to help manage shift workers. 
 Planday is also arguably a platform in the true sense of the word, in terms of integrating with integrating with various third-party software offerings that are used by shift-based businesses. 
 “Our mission is to deliver fully integrated solutions that provide a seamless experience for our customers,” says John Coldicutt, Chief Commercial Officer at Planday. 
 Meanwhile, Planday says its customer base spans 39 countries, and in the U.K., where it is estimated that 26 percent of all work is shift-based, the startup is growing 250 percent annually, although it doesn’t break out actual numbers. 
 Xero, a cloud-based accounting software platform, has announced the acquisition of Planday, a workforce management software solution provider, for up to £159.3m. 
 Although the deal entails Planday becoming a Xero subsidiary, the two businesses will continue to operate their ecosystems and partnerships freely. 
 Steve Vamos, CEO at New Zealand-based Xero, said: “The acquisition of Planday aligns with our purpose to make life better for people in small businesses and their advisors. 
“Planday’s workforce management platform helps small businesses to respond to the rapidly changing nature of work.
Planday also addresses the growing need for flexibility and rising compliance demands within the workplace.”
 Christian Brøndum, CEO at Planday, said: “We are thrilled that a company with values and a culture so aligned to our own — and a similar background — has invited us on a journey to improve our offerings. 
 “As small business plays a big part in the reemergence of the economy after a difficult economic period, both Planday and Xero want to make life better for customers, so the benefits have the potential to extend well beyond small business to their families and communities.” 
 The Wellington-based, ASX-listed company will acquire Planday, a maker of workforce management software, for an upfront payment of €155.7 million ($259m) and a possible earnout of up to €27.8m if revenue targets are hit - for a total potential consideration of €183.5 million. 
 Planday, which bills itself as   advanced employee scheduling software made simple  , is used to manage some 350,000 staff across the UK and Europe. 
 The Planday purchase continues a recent Xero strategy to accelerate growth and diversify from its accounting software roots, through acquisition. 
 Brett Smith, Director of Customer Success at Planday, explains four ways in which digital tools play an integral part in the management of care homes – particularly during a global pandemic. 
 For example, Planday’s software enables you to build smart and flexible staff rotas for care homes – which take into account employee skill, demand patterns, work regulations and employee contract terms. 
 Accounting software company Xerohas completed the acquisitions of Planday and Tickstar.Planday is a workforce management platform with more than 350,000 employee users across Europe and the UK.The company simplifies employee scheduling allowing businesses to forecast and manage their labour costs.Tickstar is a technology business that allows organisations such as Xero and its customers to connect to a global electronic invoicing network.Shares in Xeroare trading 2.04 per cent higher at $129.11. 
 Earlier this month, Xero announced it was buying out Planday, a Denmark-based workforce management platform, in a move to further grow its position in the small business market. 
 The Planday acquisition will come to a cost of €183.5 million, of which €155.7 million will be paid upfront, while a subsequent earnout payment of up to €27.8 million will be made based on product development and revenue milestones. 
 CMO John Coldicutt (pictured) explains how software rota provider Planday’s technology can improve care home efficiency, achieve costs savings and help tackle the social care recruitment crisis. 
 The CMO outlined to CHP how Planday can help care home providers become more efficient and offer their workforce greater flexibility and better communication, while raising employee engagement. 
 Using its messaging platform, Planday enables employees to swap shifts with people of equivalent skill sets who have not worked too many hours to avoid non-compliance and avoid overtime costs. 
 Geraint Thomas, Technology Transformation Partner at The Trust, said: “After using the software for over a year, we at The Disabilities Trust have been delighted with the efficiency that Planday has brought to our daily operations. 
Planday’s technology has helped us to onboard employees and our people love using the Planday app to organise their schedules.
Planday’s punch-in and punch-out functionality offers greater transparency by enabling providers to better track employees.
 Planday customer, Adrian Hendry, director at Avondale Care, said: “We can now communicate easily with staff either individually or in groups and that has been a huge bonus.” 
Planday also helps improve employee engagement which has been linked with a reduction in patient mortality.
 Looking ahead, John said Planday was keen to work with other digital providers to provide more effective, joined up solutions for care home providers.

The web version of Planday allows you to take things one step further.
 According to Brett Smith, director of customer success at Planday, which provides employee scheduling software, Covid-19 has really changed the conversation around digital tools. 
 Since Southern cuisine chain Absurd Bird started working with Planday, it has saved 3% in wage costs, adding up to £40,000 a year. 
 As Planday integrates with Absurd Bird's PoS system, team members can now get instant notifications on how much business they're doing, so they can make decisions about how many staff are needed on a particular shift. 
   Planday provided us with a system that actually worked the way it was supposed to, provided the tools managers needed to get staff scheduled and paid and overall made our lives that much easier.   
 As Planday's director of customer success Brett Smith explains:   It's more important than ever to know where and when staff are available and to make changes to shifts and schedules quickly. 
Xero on April 1 announced it had completed its Planday and Tickstar acquisitions
 In early March, Xero announced it would be acquiring Planday, a leading workforce management company. 
 In the most basic of terms and as Xero described it: 'Planday is an open platform that integrates with Xero, other accounting solutions and third-party workforce-related apps, to deliver a real-time view of staffing needs and payroll costs, alongside key business performance metrics.' 
Financial facts: Xero said it would acquire Planday for an upfront payment of €155.7 million and earnout considerations of up to €27.8 million – taking the maximum consideration to €183.5 million.
 As with Planday, Tickstar is based in Europe – Stockholm specifically – and has customers across a number of global markets. 
 iMovo, a leader in Customer Experience Management (CEM), Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics, today announced a partnership with Planday - a leading provider of online, employee scheduling and workforce management software. 
Planday is an online platform that helps businesses manage the logistics of their staff.
 With Planday, shift-based companies can easily create and share a schedule, communicate with employees, and handle HR processes. 
 With over 12 years of experience in workforce management, Planday has enabled over 28 million shifts across a range of industries including hospitality, healthcare, retail and leisure. 
 iMovo views this new partnership with Planday as strategic, because of its wide engagement with companies which are either shift-based or indeed have shift-based customer service teams of various sizes, be they iGaming companies, financial services providers or call centres 
 Commenting on the new partnership, Pierre Mallia, iMovo's managing director said   We are very excited to be partnering with a fast growth company like Planday. 
 Expanding into workforce management with Planday will allow iMovo to better serve its customers with a complete and flexible solution, especially those customers in industries like gaming, transportation and utilities (telco, water & electricity). 
   Planday will be particularly attractive to those who run a complicated-shift based business. 
To learn more about Planday and iMovo visit www.imovo.com.mt/planday.
 The Planday software that Absurd Bird adopted was able to be integrated with the ePOS system already in place in the restaurant, allowing sales data to be analysed which helps to inform decisions on how many staff would be asked to work that night. 
 Dixa, the Danish customer support platform promising more personalised customer support, has acquired Melbourne-based “knowledge management” SaaS Elevio to bolster its product and technology offerings. 
 The deal is said to be worth around $15 million, in a combination of cash and Dixa shares. 
 This sees Elevio’s own VC investors exit, and Elevio’s founders and employees incentivised as part of the Dixa family, according to Dixa co-founder and CEO, Mads Fosselius. 
“Dixa and Elevio have worked together since 2019 on several customers and great brands through a strong and tight integration between the two platforms.
 Dixa has also used Elevio’s products internally and to support our own customers for self service, knowledge base and help center”. 
 We could have built our own knowledge management system but with such a strong product already out there, built with a similar tech stack as ours and with a very aligned vision and culture fit to Dixa, we felt this was a no brainer”. 
 Founded in 2015 by Jacob Vous Petersen and Mads Fosselius, Dixa wants to end bad customer service with the help of technology that claims to be able to facilitate more personalised customer support. 
 Originally dubbed a “customer friendship” platform, the Dixa cloud-based software works across multiple channels — including phone, chat, e-mail, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and SMS — and employs a smart routing system so the right support requests reach the right people within an organisation. 
Adds the Dixa CEO: “Customer support agents still spend a lot of time helping customers with the same type of questions over and over again.
 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dixa, the Nordic customer service innovator that has transformed the EMEA customer experience (CX) market, is continuing to strengthen its footprint in the US and its disruptive new perspective on customer experience. 
 Dixa is backed by Notion Capital, Project A Ventures and SEED Capital, and is building on its recent $15m acquisition of Australian knowledge management platform Elevio by appointing Thomas Hansen, Chief Revenue Officer at UiPath, to its board of directors. 
 Dixa’s platform tackles this by allowing consumer-facing brands to serve customers across multiple channels from a single screen including social media, chat, voice and messaging apps. 
Dixa has appointed Thomas Hansen to its board of directors.
Dixa has also recruited a stellar team to lead its operations in the US.
 Mads Fosselius, CEO of Dixa commented: “Our mission has always been to build a platform for companies that love their customers. 
 The Dixa platform targets “customer-centric” brands with customer-facing agents, such as scale-ups and companies in e-commerce, transport/delivery, fintech, gaming and more. 
 Kevin Tucker, Director Customer Services Operations at Thule Group, added: “After switching to Dixa from one of the most successful players in this market, we’ve seen tremendous gains. 
 Dixa offers all channels natively, which means we now have a clear overview of our customer conversations - all from one screen. 
 With Dixa’s smart routing, we can ensure that the right agent gets the right query at the right time. 
 Scott Sinatra, Dixa’s new Chief Revenue Officer, added: “The opportunity in front of Dixa in the US is enormous. 
 Dixa is already helping a number of US brands transform their customer relationships and I’m excited to use this new wave of investment to disrupt the market even further and tap into the clear appetite for a non-ticketed, personalized and platform-centered approach.” 
 Since the global launch in 2018, Dixa has grown from just 12 to over 170 employees, with offices in Copenhagen, London, Kyiv, Berlin, Melbourne and New York, and plans to open an office in Amsterdam by the end of this year. 
 Dixa doubled its revenues during 2020 and has raised more than $50 million in funding to date with backing from Notion Capital, Project A Ventures, and SEED Capital.

Dixa expands U.S. operations to take on established CX vendors
 Dixa, a Nordic customer service innovator operating in the EMEA customer experience (CX) market, is strengthening its footprint in the U.S. Dixa is backed by Notion Capital, Project A Ventures, and SEED Capital, and is building on its recent $15 million acquisition of Australian knowledge management platform Elevio with the opening of new headquarters in New York and the recruitment of teams across the North East, South East, Central and Western America. 
 Since the global launch in 2018, Dixa has grown from just 12 to over 170 employees, with offices in Copenhagen, London, Kyiv, Berlin, Melbourne, and New York, and plans to open an office in Amsterdam by the end of this year. 
 Dixa doubled its revenues during 2020 and has raised more than $50 million in funding to date with backing from Notion Capital, Project A Ventures, and SEED Capital. 
 Customer service is one of the largest software categories in the world but, according to Dixa, the market continues to operate in transactional silos and compartmentalizes customer interactions into separate channels. 
 Dixa says its platform tackles this problem by allowing consumer-facing brands to serve customers across multiple channels from a single screen including social media, chat, voice and messaging apps. 
 As part of its U.S. expansion, Dixa has added Thomas Hansen, chief revenue officer at UiPath, to its board of directors. 
“The opportunity in front of Dixa in the U.S. is enormous.
 Every sector needs to connect better with their customers and there is a palpable pain point in the U.S. that brands are simply not connecting with customers in the most efficient and agile way possible,” said Scott Sinatra, Dixa’s new chief revenue officer. 
 “Dixa is already helping a number of U.S. brands transform their customer relationships and I’m excited to use this new wave of investment to disrupt the market even further and tap into the clear appetite for a non-ticketed, personalized and platform-centered approach.” 
 The U.S. is the most customer-centric market in the world, but it has been held back by technology being developed in silos and not brought together at the point of interaction, added Mads Fosselius, CEO of Dixa. 
 The Dixa platform targets “customer-centric” brands with customer-facing agents, such as scale-ups and companies in e-commerce, transport/delivery, fintech, gaming and more.

The acquisition supports Dixa's long term vision to simplify more aspects of customer service through personalisation and machine learning
 LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2021 / Danish customer support innovator Dixa has acquired Melbourne-based knowledge management platform Elevio in a circa US$15m deal. 
   The circa $15m acquisition supports Dixa's long term vision to simplify more aspects of customer service through personalisation and machine learning   
 Dixa's platform is used by consumer-facing brands to serve customers across multiple channels from a single screen including social media, chat, voice and messaging apps, enabling an outstanding experience for customers and agents. 
 The addition of Elevio's knowledge platform makes it easier for agents using Dixa, and their customers to access the right customer support guides and content based on their specific query, ensuring agents can spend time delivering a more meaningful customer experience when it really matters. 
 Mads Fosselius, CEO of Dixa commented:   Customer support agents still spend a lot of time helping customers with the same type of questions over and over again. 
 Chris Duell, co-founder of Elevio, added:   We're integrated with many customer support platforms but we feel that choosing to become a part of Dixa is a natural next step, as we share the same vision of making customer support less frustrating and more meaningful. 
 There's no company better at delivering multichannel customer support from a single screen than Dixa, and adding our knowledge base to that experience makes complete sense for agents and their customers.   
 Both of Elevio's co-founders will join Dixa's team for the long term with an equity stake, and the company's entire workforce, based in Melbourne, London and Toronto, will also transition to Dixa to more deeply integrate the two platforms. 
 Dixa doubled its revenues during 2020 and has raised $50 million in funding to date with backing from Notion Capital, Project A Ventures and SEED Capital. 
The New Dixa-Elevio Reation Will Benefit the New and Existing Users in Customer Service Personalization and Better Machine Learning Feature
 Dixa had raised $36M in a Series B funding, backing from Notion Capital, Project A Ventures, and SEED Capital, to move forward with hyper growth and accelerate the product development. 
 Elevio integrated their services with Dixa about two years ago, so that Dixa customers can get a better customer support platform. 
We feel that choosing to become a part of Dixa is a natural next step.
 There’s no company better at delivering multichannel customer support from a single screen than Dixa, and adding our knowledge base to that experience makes complete sense for agents and their customers.” 
 Dixa considers Elevio the finest knowledge platform available, which led them to take their existing relationship into the future. 
Dixa also assures that the existing customers would not have to come across any new format of customer experience.
 An Australian AI-driven platform backed by AirTree and Blackbird Ventures has been acquired by Danish group Dixa, following two years of partnership and hints of a new product soon to be released by both companies. 
 Duell describes integrating with Dixa - a conversational customer service software that lets brands serve customers across multiple channels - as a   natural next step   for Elevio as both companies aim to make customer support less frustrating and more meaningful. 
 They also describe the team at Dixa as   wildly intelligent   and amazing to work with. 
   We've quietly been partnering behind the scenes with Dixa for around 12 months on a product that will be released in the near future,   the founders and staff wrote. 
   So when they reached out to talk about formally joining forces and bringing together Dixa's multi-channel customer support platform and Elevio's intelligent knowledge creation and delivery offering, everything just made sense.   
 While the technology will be integrated into Dixa's platform, it will continue to operate as a separate product. 
   Customer support agents still spend a lot of time helping customers with the same type of questions over and over again,   says Dixa CEO and co-founder Mads Fosselius. 
   After having partnered with Dixa for two years, as well as integrating with many of our competitors, Elevio knows the customer support solutions market extremely well. 
 They recognised in Dixa a kindred spirit on the same path to disrupt an industry that has been slow to change.   
 Elevio may be the one being acquired but it has actually been around a lot longer than Dixa, which was established in 2018 but has quickly grown from just 12 to more than 170 employees with offices in Copenhagen, London, Kyiv, Berlin and Melbourne, as well as plans to open offices in New York and Amsterdam by the end of this year. 
 Dixa's revenues doubled last year and just one year ago it raised US$36 million (AUD$46 million) in Series B funding, taking total funding up to US$50 million (AUD$64.3 million) to date with support from Notion Capital, Project A Ventures and SEED Capital.

 Dixa is a customer service software company, founded to deliver personalised and engaging ‘customer friendships’. 
1. How did you come up with the idea for Dixa?
The shared vision of Dixa dates back to one of my first jobs.
 So, in 2015, Dixa was started to give brands the tools to unify all their customer service channels in one single platform and equip agents with the tools they need to deliver unparalleled omnichannel support experiences. 
It quickly realised that its existing ticket-based platform was overworked and turned to Dixa to allow it to keep both customers and staff happy.
 Dixa, the customer engagement platform, has closed a $36 million Series B. Leading the round is Notion Capital, with participation from existing investors Project A Ventures and SEED Capital. 
 Headcount in its product and engineering teams will also increase, and Dixa says it plans to “double down” on its go-to-market strategy in Europe and the U.S., where the company says it is seeing strong demand. 
 Noteworthy, the Series B comes less than a year after Dixa raised a $14 million Series A, and the startup claims it didn’t need the cash. 
 However, Dixa co-founder and CEO Mads Fosselius says it was all about investor-startup-fit based on Notion Capital’s track record investing in SaaS. 
 Founded in 2015 by Jacob Vous Petersen and Mads Fosselius, Dixa wants to end bad customer service with the help of technology that claims to be able to facilitate more personalised customer support. 
 Dubbed a “customer friendship” platform, the Dixa cloud-based software works across multiple channels — including phone, chat, e-mail, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and SMS — and employs a smart routing system so the right support requests reach the right people within an organisation. 
 However, Fosselius says that Dixa provides a more “holistic and data-driven customer and agent experience.” 
We think Dixa has what it takes to upend the industry with a platform that works across any channel and brings real-time intelligence to every conversation.
One of the major brands in the EMEA customer experience market is Nordic innovators Dixa.
Recent plans announced by Dixa look to build on this success and further strengthen its US presence.

 – Omada Health’s Type 2 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes+Hypertension programs have been awarded the National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) Population Health Program (PHP) Accreditation, becoming the first fully-virtual healthcare provider to earn this accreditation. 
– This certification marks a significant milestone in Omada’s ongoing commitment to transforming chronic care treatment through behavior science.
 – At the crest of the digital health wave of 2020, Omada dove into NCQA’s accreditation process to certify its 10 years of clinical research, program development and quality of care provided by coaches and care teams. 
 Achieving this universally respected accreditation spotlights Omada’s clinical work in managing the health of its Type 2 diabetes population, and sets it apart from its competitors. 
 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following its groundbreaking launch of Physician-Guided Care for diabetes and hypertension, Omada Health’s Type 2 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes+Hypertension programs have been awarded the National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) Population Health Program (PHP) Accreditation. 
 As the first fully-virtual healthcare provider to earn this accreditation, Omada was recognized for its clinical excellence and best-in-class holistic member care. 
This certification is a significant milestone in Omada’s ongoing commitment to transforming chronic care treatment through behavior science.
 “The accreditation itself is a testament to Omada's clinical rigor and to its goal of delivering clinically valuable, high-quality healthcare, differently,” says Omada's Chief Privacy and Regulatory Officer and former HHS official Lucia Savage. 
 At the crest of the digital health wave of 2020, Omada dove into NCQA’s accreditation process to certify its 10 years of clinical research, program development and quality of care provided by coaches and care teams. 
 Achieving this universally respected accreditation spotlights Omada’s clinical work in managing the health of its Type 2 diabetes population, and sets it apart from its competitors. 
NCQA’s rigorous accreditation process put Omada’s Type 2 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes+Hypertension programs under a microscope to confirm their grounding in clinically recognized protocols and best practices.
 Detailed chart audits were conducted, from glucose values and medication management techniques, to advice on weight loss and diet, all demonstrative of how Omada’s health coaches build rapport to support behavioral change. 
 “Omada meets the highest clinical standards in our care delivery, and we’re honored to be the first digital health program to gain NCQA accreditation for Type 2 diabetes programming,” says Alison Megliola, MS, RD, CDCES, who manages Omada's Type 2 Diabetes program. 
 With chronic disease potentially affecting 69 percent of an organization’s workforce, Omada performs ongoing data analysis to improve member experiences and outcomes. 
 In 2020, Omada found that 78 percent of Type 2 Diabetes program participants with measurable A1C values met A1C reduction goals within an average of six months after starting the program. 
 In April 2021, Cigna reported improved health by Omada program members, and reduced healthcare costs for employers with an average savings of $348 per member in year one and $989 in year two for Omada for Prevention. 
The NCQA PHP Accreditation aligns with Omada’s philosophy of creating lasting change through clinical guidelines and behavior science.
Omada Health combines the latest clinical treatment guidelines with breakthrough behavior science to make it possible for people with chronic conditions to achieve long term improvements in their health.
 Omada Health’s digital care programs are clinically supported and evidence-based, and have had their results published in multiple peer-reviewed journals. 
 Omada builds programs that employees don’t just try, but stick with – resulting in reduced healthcare costs that deliver long term changes in health behavior and increased ROI. 
 Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health, speaks about the company's vision, the plan behind the creation of the Insights Lab, and how other recent initiatives were launched. 
 Omada Health, a San Francisco-based digital care company, recently announced the launch of The Omada Insights Lab, a data-driven initiative to further the organization’s vision in transforming care delivery and outcomes. 
This new initiative follows Omada's mission of empowering those with chronic health conditions to lead healthier lives.
 The Insights Lab will take Omada's data science, behavior science, clinical and product design, as well as care delivery learnings to not only apply it to their members but also share some of its results within the healthcare industry to foster innovative change. 
 In a recent interview with HealthLeaders, Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health, conveyed the healthcare technology company's vision, the plan behind the creation of the Insights Lab, and how other recent initiatives were launched. 
HealthLeaders: Why does Omada want to transform healthcare delivery and outcomes?
 The recognition when founding Omada was that we needed an entirely different approach to supporting people, especially with longitudinal care. 
 For a long time, we at Omada have carried a viewpoint that has gone from provocative to a frank reality of healthcare, and that was in-person care should be option B. 
Duffy: Omada has a multidisciplinary approach to care.
 What I saw internally at Omada as we scaled were these cross-functional collaborations in the spirit of changing care, as well as improving and iterating the program. 
The first is internal in the ways that we support our members; [continuing] to institutionalize this multidisciplinary approach that we've had in Omada.
 In digital health, especially, if you have created all the needed pieces yourself, which Omada has, all the data is kind of connected so every single person that joins the program has a chance to make it more valuable for the next. 
It's been fun to watch the teams at Omada latch on to it and get so excited about it.
HL: What are some other strategic initiatives has Omada recently announced?
Omada has great clinical capabilities in areas like diabetes.
 It's a special new capability for Omada, and it's one of those where, in healthcare, there are sometimes these trade-offs between an engaging experience and cost and outcomes. 
 There's also a belief system at Omada where we think the real power of digital health comes from integration between people and technology, and clinicians and technology, versus technology alone.

 Omada Health, one of the U.S.’s original virtual healthcare providers, today announced the creation of the Omada Insights Lab. 
 Omada offers care management for diabetes, musculoskeletal issues, preventative health, hypertension and behavioral health. 
 “A shared sense of commitment with an Omada care professional increases the likelihood of a better outcome by 250%,” Duffy said. 
One tactic Omada uses to keep patients on track is the “nudge.”
 Like your Apple watch that tells you when to stand up or breathe, the Omada app can remind its diabetes patients to have a meal and to measure their blood sugar, for example. 
 As a result, the Omada doctors have made changes to their care delivery. 
Omada took these insights and reduced the use of nudges and implemented ways for the care team to interact with the patients more.
 While Omada is already using the more than a billion data points it’s recorded from 450,000 members in the company’s 10 years of business to improve its own tools, with the launch of the Lab, the company also plans to share the data and strategies with the broader medical community through content on its website and other outlets.

 OMADA HEALTH LAUNCHES PHYSICIAN-GUIDED CARE PROGRAM, THE FIRST VIRTUAL CARDIOMETABOLIC CLINIC 
 Today Omada Health announced the launch of Physician-Guided Care for diabetes and hypertension, creating the first virtual cardiometabolic clinic. 
Omada is adding virtual consultations with physicians for members who need more help controlling their conditions.
 Omada began building the foundation for an integrated virtual clinic ten years ago, by creating a digital platform driving lifestyle behavior change. 
 Starting with that hardest challenge - changing people’s behavior – Omada has added care programs over the years for mental health, musculoskeletal conditions, and diabetes and hypertension management, as well as enhanced monitoring capabilities. 
This includes continuous glucose monitors that are now available to eligible members as a part of Omada’s diabetes program.
 Now, with Physician-Guided Care, Omada is adding the ability to integrate medication prescription, medication management, and lab orders and results, providing the support a member needs between visits with their primary care physician in a truly scalable, accessible way. 
 “At Omada, we’re defining a new era of health ­­­– an era that is built on a belief that everyone with a chronic condition can improve their health,” said Carolyn Jasik, MD, Omada Health’s Chief Medical Officer. 
 “Omada’s new, virtual-first care platform offers a way to supplement meaningful in-person care and create a surround sound experience for members battling complex conditions.” 
 This expansion of Omada’s programs will help members have access to care that is more efficient, more effective, and integrated into the in-person ecosystem. 
 Omada plans to expand its Physician-Guided Care into its pre-diabetes and weight management, behavioral health, and musculoskeletal programs starting in 2022. 
Omada Health combines the latest clinical protocols with breakthrough behavior science to make it possible for people with chronic conditions to achieve long term improvements in their health.
 Omada Health’s digital care programs are clinically supported and evidence-based, and have had its results published in multiple peer-reviewed journals. 
 Omada builds programs that employees don’t just try, but stick with – resulting in reduced healthcare costs that deliver long term changes in health behavior and increased ROI. 
 Now, those tasks can be completed remotely and all in the same place: Omada Health’s digital health platform. 
 Omada initially launched the platform to guide patients with chronic health conditions through the process of changing their behavior to improve their health, with the help of tracking tools and informational guides for weight management, daily activity levels and more. 
 Most recently, in May 2020, Omada received a $57 million investment from investment fund Perceptive Advisors, about half of which was then funneled into additional growth with the acquisition of virtual physical therapy startup Physera. 
 The two newest additions to the platform integrate computer vision technology and telehealth consultations to boost Omada’s digital offerings for patients with diabetes, hypertension and musculoskeletal conditions. 
 Doctors can also tap other patient information gathered by the Omada platform, including continuous glucose monitor and other device readings. 
 The physician-guided care program will be added to Omada’s pre-diabetes and weight management, behavioral health and musculoskeletal programs in 2022. 
 In the meantime, Omada has already beefed up its musculoskeletal care offerings with the second of the recent upgrades, which integrates computer vision artificial intelligence into physical therapy treatments. 
 Omada’s platform uses AI to analyze movements and range of motion via video, generating precise measurements almost immediately. 
 The virtual physical therapy program will be available on Cigna offshoot Evernorth’s digital health formulary, as well as on the Omada platform. 
 Earlier this month, the company unveiled its Omada Insights Lab, focused on using a decade’s worth of user-submitted health data to develop new and long-lasting interventions. 
That’s why Omada Insights Lab is so crucial.”
 Quan continued, “The Omada Insights Lab has and continues to learn from this rich history of virtual interactions to reinforce the approaches that are the most effective for the long-term health of our members and change the unit economics of care delivery.” 
 Omada's new Physician-Guided Care Program is looking to help patients cut down on frequent trips to the doctor with its virtual cardiometabolic clinic, which provides telemedicine consultations to Omada members. 
 After the company inked a deal with Abbott back in 2019, members using the FreeStyle Libre system could integrate with Omada's app, which allowed the digital health company more insights into a patient's health. 
   There was a fax pattern that we kept seeing from our participants where we would notice something and say to them, 'We recommend you go into your primary care doc and have your medications looked at,'   Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada, told MobiHealthNews. 
   On the member side, instead of having to make a virtual visit or show up in person to have your medication adjusted 5,10 milligrams, and take time off of work to do it, you can do it basically instantly within the Omada experience which is so much more convenient,   Duffy said. 
Omada got its start in the diabetes space.
 According to CrunchBase, Omada has a total of $256.5 million in venture funding. 
 However, Omada isn't the only provider in the chronic care management space.

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Omada Health announced that registration is now open for Mindset 2021, a free, virtual event which aims to reinvent the way the industry thinks about chronic care by applying the science of behavior change. 
 “The science of behavior change and digital care delivery is leading to breakthroughs in the way we’re able to improve health for people with chronic conditions,” said Sean Duffy, Omada co-founder and CEO. 
 Exclusive announcements from Omada Health will also be unveiled during the two-day event, taking place April 14-15, 2021.

 Roger Williams, father of us all 
 Let us now praise Roger Williams (1603-1683), founder of the first Baptist church in America and of the colony that became Rhode Island. 
 “We must look to Roger Williams, more than to (Thomas) Jefferson or (James) Madison, as the true builder of our American Bill of Rights,” wrote Charles Small Longacre in 1939, “because all the provisions of civil and religious liberty as set forth in the matchless Constitution of the United States were incorporated in principle in the charter of Rhode Island as conceived and framed by Roger Williams. 
 In the best tradition of Roger Williams’ American dream of freedom, let’s allow each other to think and speak freely.

 That kid-turned-man is Roger Penske, the business titan and racing junkie who now owns and operates this place and this race that he has loved since that May Sunday 70 years ago. 
   Anyone who has ever worked with him, for him, or even raced against him knows that nothing gets by Roger,   says Will Power, the longest tenured of Penske's three drivers.

 Pillar of the Dawson County community — These are just a few of the most common phrases used to describe Roger Slaton, who died at the age of 80 on Sunday, June 6, 2021. 
 “Roger really was everything we all aspire to be,” Dawson County Chamber of Commerce President Mandy Power said. 
 According to Power and former chamber president Christie Moore, Slaton’s business, Roger Slaton State Farm, was one of the chamber’s oldest members, and as a member, Slaton was a fierce advocate. 
 “When I think of Roger Slaton, I think of Dawson County, the two are inseparable to me. 
 “When Roger supported you, he was all in and that applied to everything from the Chamber to the Dawson County School System.” 
 “I don’t know of many people that ever made a bigger impact than Roger on this community,” Wilson said in an interview with the Dawson County News. 
 “Roger touched so many different aspects of the community ... whether it was church or school or business or chamber of commerce, Relay for Life, there’s just so much that Roger had a hand in.” 
 A good deal of these pioneering investigations have involved today's Teach Me in 10 guest: Roger Pertwee, an emeritus professor at the University of Aberdeen.

Value investing is back — and no one’s happier about that than John Rogers.
 Rogers is CEO and chairman of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, which says it’s the oldest Black-owned money manager in the country. 
 Value stocks began outperforming growth in October, and Rogers, 63, maintains the party is just beginning. 
 “The last 12 years were the most painful period for value relative to growth,” Rogers says. 
 Rogers was introduced to stock investing by his father, a lawyer, at the age of 12 and quickly fell in love with it. 
But investing wasn’t Rogers’ first career choice.
 As a student at Princeton University, where he captained the basketball team, Rogers intended to become a basketball coach. 
 However, at Princeton, legendary coach Pete Carril told Rogers in no uncertain terms that he lacked court vision. 
 In his sophomore year, Rogers was the last player Carril selected to the squad. 
 “He said, ‘I’ll keep you on the team because you play hard, but you have no idea what you’re doing,’” Rogers says. 
 “Fortunately, it seemed like I had the vision to choose stocks,” Rogers says. 
 Since starting Ariel almost 40 years ago, Rogers has hewed to his small- and mid-cap investing style — an approach he modeled after his hero, Warren Buffett. 
 “People can argue whether Michael Jordan, LeBron James, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the best basketball player of all time,” Rogers says. 
 At Ariel, Rogers says, the investment team targets “the real leaders in industries — high-quality companies with the ability to grow faster that have true moats around them. 
 After Buffett, Rogers admires a number of other top investors, including Mario Gabelli of GAMCO Investors, Bill Miller of Miller Value Partners, Ralph Wanger of Wanger Asset Management, Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo & Gardner, Staley Cates of Southeastern Asset Management, and Eddie Brown of Brown Capital Management. 
 “All of them are so quirky and comfortable being independent thinkers,” Rogers says. 
 Rogers says he didn’t feel an obligation to break racial barriers himself, but the existence of such barriers “was drilled into me as a child.” 
 His mother’s grandfather had operated what Rogers says was the largest Black-owned hotel in the country, but it was burned down in the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. 
Rogers does feel an obligation to help shrink the racial wealth disparity.
 At Ariel, Rogers and his team have pushed portfolio companies to diversify their leadership. 
 “We have a long history of getting the first minority on companies’ boards,” Rogers says. 
Rogers says he learned about the importance of environmental and governance issues while serving on the boards of companies such as McDonald’s Corp. and Aon.
Rogers and his colleagues have tweaked their investment approach in other ways over the years.
 For example, “we learned the hard way through the 2008-09 financial crisis that we needed to up our game on balance-sheet analysis,” Rogers says. 
 “That’s a critical improvement, which will hopefully protect us on the downside,” Rogers says. 
A talk by Nobel laureate economist Daniel Kahneman introduced Rogers to the topic.
Rogers cites several elements of behavioral finance that have been useful for Ariel:
 “People have an inability to look over the horizon,” Rogers says. 
 “You have to look outside your comfort zone and hear a contrary perspective,” Rogers says. 
 “That’s critical to our success, because it’s so easy to get swept up in biases,” Rogers says. 
 As for stocks Ariel has purchased based on all of this philosophy, Rogers’ favorites include investment bank Lazard, private-equity firm KKR & Co., Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp., and TV-ratings tracker Nielsen Co. 
 “We love fee-generating financial services companies,” Rogers says. 
 According to Rogers, the company shines in global investment banking, corporate advisory work, and asset management. 
 “We think more assets will go into private equity,” Rogers says. 
 And while MSG Entertainment CEO James Dolan is a controversial figure in the sports and media industries, “he has done nothing but make money for investors,” Rogers says. 
 And Rogers is excited about the MSG Sphere at The Venetian, an entertainment venue the company is building in Las Vegas. 
 “I’m optimistic that will be a game changer for traditional arenas,” Rogers says. 
 While the last decade-plus has been challenging for value firms like Ariel, Rogers is sanguine about the future of value stocks. 
 Rogers believes the economy’s hot recovery — GDP, for example, grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter — favors value stocks. 
 In a higher interest-rate environment, Rogers believes investors will value the booming short-term earnings of cyclical companies over the long-term earnings of growth companies. 
 When Rogers was a junior at Princeton, Coach Carril asked him to host a high school basketball prospect from Chicago. 
Rogers became good friends with Robinson and through him met Barack Obama.
 When Obama entered the political scene in Chicago, “I was just enough older [three years] that he felt comfortable coming to me for political and fundraising advice,” Rogers says. 
 With his off-the-charts work ethic and competitiveness and his strong vision, Obama would make an excellent investor, Rogers says. 
Rogers thinks Obama would be comfortable investing in industries that evolve with the country.
Rogers’ friendship with Obama isn’t his only high-profile connection outside the investment world.
 Rogers was able to obtain a video of the competition, held at a Jordan fantasy camp in 2003, and The Wall Street Journal posted it online. 
 Rogers had the audacity to pat the Hall of Famer on the stomach after his first score, and Jordan moaned, “Oh, no,” just before Rogers’ game-winning shot dropped through the basket. 
Enough hoop junkies found the clip so that Rogers has been stopped on the street and asked if he’s the guy who beat Michael Jordan.
Rogers ranks the victory among his top ten accomplishments.
 “If it was to ten, he’d win, and if we played another 100 times, he’d probably win them all,” Rogers says. 
 Jordan, legendary for his competitive streak, has been “nothing but friendly and kind to me,” Rogers says. 
(CNN) Roger Federer has become known for his cool and composed tennis but the 20-time grand slam champion wasn't happy during his French Open win against Marin Cilic.
 The market is incredibly competitive, with brands like Soundboks, Bose, Sonos, JBL, and Ultimate Ears (UE) constantly putting out incredible, powerful, and – perhaps most importantly – loud wireless speakers for beats on-the-go. 
 Unlike any other speaker on the market, Soundboks has revolutionary sound quality, and that’s only refined even further with the Gen 3 version of the device – sometimes referred to as NEW SOUNDBOKS. 
Soundboks is one of the most party friendly Bluetooth speakers ever made.
The new Soundboks Bluetooth speaker is not one of those.
​SOUNDBOKS (gen. 3) speakers (SKAA network)
SOUNDBOKS - The company was created by 3 friends who wanted to Break Through the Noise in the speaker world by bringing concert-quality sound everywhere you go.
 The completely redesigned Gen 3 SOUNDBOKS speaker features concert-level volume at 126 dB, TeamUP wireless connectivity (for up to five SOUNDBOKS speakers), and a rechargeable battery that can last up to 40 hours. 
 Fully portable, waterproof, and even sporting a removable steel grill for easy customization, the New SOUNDBOKS is the perfect way to escape every day routines and submerge in a rich sound experience that feels like you're really there. 
 Soundboks, a Danish company that started out by crowdfunding, says that it has built the world's loudest portable wireless loudspeaker, which it claims can deliver 126dBSPL. 
 The latest '3' version of the Soundboks uses three Class-D amplifiers, each rated at 72-watts continuous per channel, to drive two 254mm bass/midrange drivers and a 25mm compression tweeter via a 2.5-way crossover. 
 The amplifiers (built by Merus Audio) are powered by a single 12.8V, 7.8Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery that Soundboks claims will enable 40 hours of playback at mid-volume or five hours at full volume. 
 Bluetooth is 5.0 with Soundboks claiming   lower latency stereo performance   through the use of SKAA Audio's Pro SKAA circuitry. 
“Over the past four years we’ve been integrating community feedback with the vision of the speaker we have always wanted to build; the result is the new Soundboks.
 Up to five individual Soundboks 3s can be interlinked, so there's a free app that allows you to specify whether a specific unit will handle the left or the right channel, or operate in mono. 
 The app also allows you to equalise the sound to your own preference, or use one of Soundboks' own sound modes: Bass+, Power, or Indoor. 
 Available now, the Soundboks 3 (also known as 'The New Soundboks') sells for £815, $999, AU$1599. 
 The New Soundboks was built to be as loud as it gets, but it manages to do it with impressive sound quality while it’s booming tunes to a crowd. 
 For Danish brand Soundboks, ‘big’ is a relative term and its signature speaker for 2020, The New Soundboks, is monstrous by comparison. 
 But the rock-stage aesthetic is nothing new for Soundboks, who first started out in a garage in Denmark and a Kickstarter campaign for their first speaker. 
The New Soundboks looks like the kind of speaker you’d pass by in a nightclub.
 There’s even a dedicated app to set it up and install the latest firmware, like we did when we first got the New Soundboks. 
The Soundboks app isn’t especially deep but it does have a few key features you would need to keep an eye on.
 Regardless, you may be more inclined to really take things to another level by pairing with other Soundboks speakers under the TeamUp feature. 
It’s almost ironic that Soundboks puts the volume up to 11.
The good news is that the New Soundboks sounds great — even better than we expected at louder volumes.
All of Soundboks’ battery ratings are based on cranking the speaker up to 11.
 A speaker like the New Soundboks may seem out of place while a pandemic is going on, but it’s more versatile than it looks. 
 LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- SOUNDBOKS, the company building the world's first Bluetooth Performance Speaker, is amping up the audio world in 2021 with the New SOUNDBOKS. 
 With many in-person events still on hold due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the New SOUNDBOKS' audio capabilities provide a front-row seat to enhance virtual entertainment. 
 The New SOUNDBOKS is available online for purchase with optimal sound customization available through the   SOUNDBOKS   app free to download on any mobile device. 
   As people continue to minimize interaction and stay safe during the pandemic, the SOUNDBOKS will help consumers feel more connected with the ability to transport to any event virtually through premium sound quality,   said Jesper Thiel Thomsen, CEO of SOUNDBOKS. 
 The completely redesigned SOUNDBOKS, which is the 3rd generation of the design, features concert-level volume at 126 dB, TeamUP wireless connectivity (for up to five SOUNDBOKS speakers), microphone and instrument inputs and even a removable steel grill for easy customization. 
 Fully portable and no need for external power, the SOUNDBOKS weighs 34 pounds and is the only Bluetooth speaker with a removable battery that can last up to 40 hours on a single charge. 
 Whether listening to virtual concerts, live games or re-creating workout classes from home, the New SOUNDBOKS offers an immersive audio experience unlike any other to transport consumers to their favorite destinations. 
   The New SOUNDBOKS was designed to help listeners 'Break Through the Noise'—to exceed experiential limitations and recreate your own entertainment indoors or outdoors,   said Thomsen. 
 To learn more about the New SOUNDBOKS and all its groundbreaking features, visit www.SOUNDBOKS.com. 
 SOUNDBOKS was founded in 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Take a Danish sound company launching in Australia known as Soundboks.
 Granted, parties have changed a bit in the past couple of years — thanks, coronavirus — but once we’re over this, you can expect some sense of partying to keep on keepin’ on (maybe with social distancing), and for that, Soundboks has been rebuilding its take on the tech. 
 The result is a speaker that features the name of the company, and is known simply as the Soundboks Bluetooth Performance Speaker, with the result being a large speaker that wouldn’t be out of kilter at a gig or concert, but being built a little differently. 
 Featuring handles on the side to help you carry it, the Soundboks is made to be splash resistant and features silicon balls on the corners to absorb impacts, while the grill of the speaker is made from a steel that’s hard to make a dent on, so much the company calls it “dent proof”. 
 Use the latter, and you’ll find the Soundboks can talk to as much as five other Soundboks speakers wirelessly, operating with as much as 40 hours of battery life independently. 
 “We were very focused on creating an unmatched sound experience, wireless connectivity and battery life were critical for that,” said Jesper Thiel Thomson, CEO of Soundboks. 
 In Australia, you’ll find the Soundboks speaker at JB HiFi for its $1599.95 price tag, though you might need to bring your own pool party for full effect. 
 It has everything: a sturdy housing, Bluetooth, large battery, XLR-inputs and several methods to connect multiple Soundboks. 
 Indoor or out, the New Soundboks sounds great. 
 There’s nothing fancy to the style of the Soundboks 2, and to me, that’s part of its appeal. 
Quick note: This product is called the New Soundboks.
 The previous version was called the Soundboks 2, yet this one is called the New Soundboks. 
Click the speaker on and the New Soundboks comes alive.
This battery is what makes the Soundboks stand apart from other speakers.
The new speaker can also be daisy-chained to five other Soundboks speakers either through wires or Bluetooth.
Soundboks was founded in 2014 and participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2016 program.
 And in those situations, the Soundboks excels because of its power, portability and ability to link more speakers together. 
 Promising to break through the limitations of traditional speakers, SOUNDBOKS offers   a new advanced amplifier system and the highest level of continuous performance with wireless connectivity and 40 hours of battery life.   
 A new brand says it is   breaking through the noise of the Bluetooth speaker industry   with its new   SOUNDBOKS Bluetooth Performance Speaker.   
 Jesper Thiel Thomsen, CEO of SOUNDBOKS said:   We have finally created the speaker we always wanted.   
“Over the past four years we’ve been integrating community feedback with the vision of the speaker we have always wanted to build; the result is The New SOUNDBOKS.
 We're told this new SOUNDBOKS model is   completely redesigned  , featuring   126 dB volume, TeamUP wireless connectivity (up to five SOUNDBOKS speakers), pro panel inputs, SOUNDBOKS app which allows regular updates and new features to get pushed to your speaker, and even a removable steel grill for easy customisation.   
 Billed as being   extremely portable and easy to use, the SOUNDBOKS weighs 34 pounds (15.42kg) and is   the only Bluetooth speaker with a removable battery that can last up to 40 hours on a single charge.   
Danish audio manufacturer Soundboks is bringing what it bills as the world’s loudest portable Bluetooth performance speaker to Australia.
 The New Soundboks Bluetooth Performance Speaker features a maximum 126 dB of volume, as well as wireless connectivity with up to four other Soundboks speakers, and a removable battery that can last 40 hours on a single charge. 
 According to Jesper Thiel Thomsen, CEO of Soundboks, the company has finally created the speaker it has always wanted to. 
“Over the past four years we’ve been integrating community feedback with the vision of the speaker we have always wanted to build; the result is The New Soundboks.
The New Soundboks Bluetooth Performance Speaker is available for RRP $1599.95 through JB Hi-Fi and soundboks.com.au.
 You don’t need to wear your car battery down by playing the stereo anymore, not with the latest $999 Bluetooth speaker from Soundboks. 
 Okay, so the OG Soundboks was a Kickstarter back in 2016 when over a thousand people liked the idea of a huge speaker they could take anywhere. 
 Now it’s 2019, and the third iteration of the Soundboks speaker is here. 
Dismissing the massive Soundboks as “just another Bluetooth speaker” would be doing a disservice to music.
 It’s also got a 3.5mm AUX input, one 3.5mm input, two XLR inputs, and a new wireless technology that allows up to 5 Soundboks to connect together in perfect sync. 
 The standout feature for me is the TeamUP feature, which wirelessly connects up to 5 Soundboks together, in perfect sync. 
 That’s a perfect pairing with the go-everywhere-do-anything Soundboks, and it really elevates an already great speaker system to a fantastic one. 
 It’ll also pair with other SKAA-enabled devices, like the Syncronice Hub which worked fantastically to send the audio from my DJ controller to the Soundboks speakers. 
 Soundboks has a real winner here, held back by the relatively high price of $999 per speaker. 
 Soundboks takes all that mess out of the equation, leaving you to only worry about the music. 
 Soundboks knows this, and the third iteration of its bass-pounding, rave-inducing speaker will literally melt your face. 
Soundboks has been making insane Bluetooth speakers since the first version was successfully crowdfunded back in 2016.
 It also comes with wireless linking via SKAA, which lets you sync up to 5 Soundboks together in perfect harmony. 
The 2019 Soundboks has a whopping 126db volume rating – that’s somewhere between a thunderclap and an aircraft taking off while you’re standing near it
 We’ve got two of the $999 Soundboks here for testing out this weekend, so look out for our full review in the coming weeks.

 “The New SOUNDBOKS is loaded with features, but what really sets it apart from the competition is the ground-breaking TeamUp feature made possible by SKAA technology,” explained Rex Whitehead, Eleven Engineering Executive Vice President – Sales & Marketing. 
 “SKAA includes a multi-speaker networking technology called Nadja, which allows up to five New SOUNDBOKS speakers to be wirelessly driven by one Bluetooth source, all playing in perfect sync. 
 While others are forced to connect multiple speakers via wires, that’s not the case with the New SOUNDBOKS. 
 Just feed the New SOUNDBOKS an audio source, and let SKAA do the rest. 
 If you think one New SOUNDBOKS speaker is loud, just wait until you hear five that are wirelessly networked via SKAA.” 
 Every New SOUNDBOKS speaker includes SKAA wireless and Bluetooth wireless, as well as multiple wired aux inputs. 
 Since the New SOUNDBOKS is 100 percent compatible, it will work seamlessly with all pre-existing and future SKAA compatible devices, and the SKAA ecosystem as a whole. 
 SKAA is the new wireless HiFi audio standard developed by Eleven Engineering, Inc., and the ideal choice to take the New SOUNDBOKS performance speakers to the next level. 
 Designed in Denmark by a trio of passionate friends trying to find the perfect outdoor party speaker, SOUNDBOKS was originally designed to be the ultimate portable speaker. 
 Establishing new category of Bluetooth Performance Speakers, SOUNDBOKS launched in 2015 and has been growing ever since, co-located in Copenhagen and Los Angeles. 
 Well, the folks behind Soundboks basically took the whole portability piece of the equation, and almost, but not entirely, set it aside in favor of delivering a speaker that actually sounds like you want a speaker to sound, which is why I jumped to give one a try when they offered.

Genmab and Bolt Biotherapeutics have teamed up to develop bispecific immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs).
The collaboration brings together Genmab’s bispecific capabilities with Bolt’s innate immune stimulant platform to create a new type of immuno-oncology drug.
 The idea has caught the attention of Genmab, the biotech behind Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster anti-CD38 antibody Darzalex. 
 Genmab is contributing its own antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies to the collaboration, positioning the partners to develop a twist on the ISAC concept. 
Genmab is paying Bolt $10 million upfront and making a $15 million equity investment in the biotech to enter into the deal as well as agreeing to fully fund preclinical and early clinical development of all candidates.
 In return, Genmab has secured the option to develop and commercialize up to three candidates. 
Bolt is in line to receive up to $285 million in milestones for each candidate Genmab takes forward on its own.
The agreement is the latest example of Genmab’s interest in partnering to access technologies that may complement its antibody expertise.
 In 2019, for example, Genmab partnered with CureVac to work on mRNA-based antibody products. 
That deal came around 18 months after Genmab struck a deal to access Immatics Biotechnologies’ T-cell receptor capabilities.
 Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved Janssen’s RYBREVANT™ (amivantamab-vmjw), a fully human bispecific antibody, for the treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. 
 In July 2012, Genmab entered into a collaboration with Janssen to create and develop bispecific antibodies using Genmab’s DuoBody technology platform. 
This is the first regulatory approval for a product that was created using Genmab’s proprietary DuoBody® technology platform.
 Under the agreement with Janssen, Genmab will receive royalties on net sales of RYBREVANT. 
“The U.S. FDA approval of Janssen’s RYBREVANT is a significant milestone as it represents the first regulatory approval for a therapeutic product created using Genmab’s DuoBody technology platform.
 As described in a recent Journal of Biological Chemistry article, the creation of amivantamab was a team effort between Janssen R&D and Genmab,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.

Danish biotech company Genmab has announced that it has entered an oncology research and development collaboration with Bolt Biotherapeutics.
The companies will evaluate Genmab’s antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies alongside Bolt’s immune-stimulating antibody conjugate (ISAC) technology platform.
 Genmab is set to fund the research, including the preclinical and clinical development of each candidate through clinical proof to concept. 
 “This exciting collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to combine Genmab’s innovative bispecific antibody technologies with Bolt’s powerful, advanced ISAC technology to develop targeted antibody products with the potential to transform cancer treatment,” said Jan van de Winkel, chief executive officer of Genmab. 
 In addition, Bolt is eligible to receive total milestone payments of up to $285 per therapeutic candidate that is exclusively developed and commercialised by Genmab, as well as tiered royalties. 
 While Genmab will fully fund pre-clinical and early clinical development of all candidates, if a candidate is co-developed, the costs will be split equally between the two companies. 
“Our joint vision is to leverage Genmab’s and Bolt’s innovative technologies to develop a completely new type of ISAC with the aim to transform the way cancer is treated.
 “We are delighted to be collaborating with the Genmab team and to have their deep expertise in discovering and developing bispecific antibodies brought to bear on this approach as we continue our mission to develop treatments that address key unmet needs for patients with cancer,” he added.

Genmab has enlisted the help of Bolt Biotherapeutics to develop a new class of immune-boosting antibody conjugates for cancer in a deal that could be worth up to $880 million.
 Denmark-based Genmab is paying $10 million upfront to its US counterpart and making a $15 million equity investment to get the project started, funding R&D to the proof-of-concept stage in early clinical trials. 
 Genmab is supplying the bispecific antibody technology, while Bolt will contribute its innate immune stimulant platform, which it says can re-programme the tumour microenvironment to trigger a localised immune response against the cancer. 
 Bolt’s own ISACs consist of a single-headed antibody, linker and proprietary immune stimulant molecule, so the partnership with Genmab will allow it to add a second molecular target into the mix, which could increase the specificity of the drug or add functionality like recruiting specific immune cells. 
 Genmab’s antibody platform has already resulted in three approved products, including Johnson & Johnson’s big-selling multiple myeloma therapy Darzalex (daratumumab), and its bispecific pipeline includes several clinical stage candidates headed by AbbVie-partnered epcoritamab for blood cancers. 
 Many of Genmab’s alliances to date have focused on deploying its own antibody platforms against targets of interest to its partners, but it has also been active in tapping into other companies technologies, as in the latest Bolt deal.

 'Here we go again': This time, it's a donkey on the loose in Johnston 
A donkey spotted running through the streets of Johnston is the latest in this town's book of animal stories.
 And now, a donkey is apparently on the loose. 
The donkey was seen in the 2900 block of Hartford Avenue around 7 p.m.
Some Channel 10 viewers sent the station video and still images of the donkey cruising along the road.
But he also noted that the donkey creates a public safety concern.
 In a later interview with The Journal, Polisena said he typically wakes up at 2:30 or 3 a.m. and will likely scout for the runaway donkey Tuesday morning, if it hasn't been corralled by then. 
It's unclear where the runaway Johnston donkey came from.
 Nobody has reported a missing donkey, according to Polisena. 
Polisena seems concerned that the donkey will prove as elusive as the third turkey.
Polisena has seen video of the donkey running among cars.
 The police department in Johnston, Rhode Island, believes that the donkey escaped from a small residential farm 
Runaway Donkey on the Loose in Same RI Town That Saw Escaped Cow This Year: 'Here We Go Again'
Residents of a small Rhode Island town are questioning their luck while looking for a donkey that escaped from a local farm earlier this week - nearly four months after a runaway steer evaded capture in the same town.
 In Johnston, Rhode Island, police first became aware of the missing donkey on Sunday night after multiple residents spotted the animal wandering alongside a busy road. 
   I learned that the donkey basically escaped from a small residential farm on the Johnston/Scituate line,   Joseph Razza, the Johnston police chief, told local TV station NBC 10 WJAR. 
Ed Plasse told NBC 10 WJAR he spotted the donkey early Monday morning as he drove down a local road.
 Razza said the donkey is cream-colored and medium-sized and is likely a female donkey, also known as a   jenny   or   jennet,   according to NBC 10 WJAR. 
The police chief is encouraging locals to stay alert while driving and not to approach the donkey if they see it.
A representative from the Johnston Police Department confirmed to PEOPLE that the donkey still has not been found on Tuesday afternoon.
Police started getting calls about a donkey roaming the streets of town late Sunday night.
 “Although a donkey is a domesticated animal, this one is not very tame,” said Johnston Police Chief Joseph Razza. 
 “We encourage the public, if they encounter the donkey, to call us or Scituate police, and we will make arrangements to hopefully capture it safely.” 
 According to Razza and Polisena, the donkey was unloaded from a vehicle at a residence in Scituate, near the west side of town, when it escaped. 
 “Officers arrived, but the donkey was not there,” Razza said. 
 Finding a donkey in Johnston, however, is a little bit like finding a needle in a haystack. 
 “The donkey put us on the map again,” Polisena said. 
 The donkey is a female, and medium-sized, according to police. 
 The donkey, however, seems intent to travel. 
Public safety is the mayor’s priority; the donkey’s successful capture a close second.
The donkey was last reported seen along Trim Town Road in Scituate around 8 a.m.
The same Rhode Island town that had to deal with a runaway steer earlier this year is now investigating reports of a donkey on the loose.
The donkey was first spotted in Johnston at about 7 p.m.
WJAR-TV shared video captured by a motorist that showed the donkey trotting down a street as cars whizzed past.
 “Here we go again,” Mayor Joseph Polisena told WPRO radio on Monday morning, saying he was concerned that the donkey might cause a car crash. 
 No one has reported a missing donkey, but Polisena noted that there are several farms in the area. 
 Animal control will patrol the area where the donkey was last scene, he said. 
 NAIROBI - Kenya's population of donkeys is under threat after the High Court lifted a 2020 ban on donkey slaughterhouses, allowing them to resume selling the meat and hides to Asian markets. 
The high price for donkey hides for use in Chinese medicine has led to donkey poaching and sparked fears the animals could eventually go extinct.
 Kilena Simeon, a Masai farmer living in the border county of Kajiado, drives her herd of donkeys in search of pasture. 
 For years, she says, women like her have relied on the donkeys to ease the burden of labor in their homes and on their farms. 
   We get our earnings from our donkeys. 
 FILE - A girl leads donkeys as Turkana people migrate to find water and grazing land for cattle in Ilemi Triangle, Kenya, July 23, 2019. 
 In early March, Kenya's High Court lifted a ban on the slaughter of donkeys for both meat and hide for medicine in the Asian market. 
 Donkey slaughter was legalized in Kenya in 2012, leading to a rapid decimation of the animal's population and cross-border theft. 
   There were many issues that were coming up of donkey theft, of slaughtering of underage donkeys, of cross-border smuggling of donkeys, but most importantly, communities were losing their livelihoods, because abattoirs were slaughtering very many donkeys a day, much more than naturally the donkeys can replenish,   Ojwang said. 
 The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in 2019 that the country's donkey population had decreased over the previous 10 years, from 1.8 million donkeys in 2009 to 1.17 million in 2019. 
   These slaughterhouses were slaughtering about 200 donkeys a day, sometimes 250, but they have an installed capacity of about 1,000, so if you look at even our country's population, if they continue slaughtering at that rate, which is too high, it will be a few short years before the population of donkeys in Kenya gets almost decimated,   he said. 
Kenya has four donkey abattoirs spread across four counties.
 When that happens, activists say, donkey numbers will resume their downward slide, presenting a real problem for rural women of the country and the region. 
 While videos of dogs and cats showering love on their humans are common on the Internet, this video of a donkey meeting a little girl has left many surprised. 
 “This donkey is reunited with the girl who raised it,” says the caption with which the video has been posted. 
The clip shows the donkey braying as it walks towards the girl who is standing on the other side of a gate.
 As the girl pets the donkey, the animal rests its head on her shoulder and refuses to let go. 
This donkey is reunited with the girl who raised it..
 Community Corner Donkey On The Loose + New State Police Barracks + Blood Emergency The latest news and events in Woonsocket, right in your inbox! 
 In today's Daily, we share the latest news about a donkey on the loose in Johnston, the $28 million project to construct a new State Police Southern Barracks, and a blood shortage at the Rhode Island Blood Center. 
1. A donkey is on the loose in Johnston just months after the capture of a wayward steer.
It is unclear where the animal came from as no one has reported a missing donkey.
 White-spotted donkeys might be cute, but breeding two together in hopes of getting a white-spotted baby donkey could be deadly. 
Genotyping Solid and White-Spotted Donkeys and an All-White Donkey Foal
 Bellone and her fellow researchers collected photographs and hair samples of 55 donkeys, including 17 that had white spotting and one young foal that was entirely white, with pink skin and blue eyes. 
They ran genotyping on DNA they extracted from the donkeys’ hairs and looked for two variants of the KIT gene.
 In donkeys, however, researchers have only found two variants: W and Ws. 
 A single copy of the W variant, also known as Dominant White, leads to an all-white donkey with pink skin and dark-colored eyes, she said. 
 However, it’s extremely rare, with only one known healthy donkey reported to have the mutation to date. 
 In the new study, Bellone and her team found that all 17 white-spotted donkeys had one copy (inherited from only one parent) of the Ws gene. 
 Two of those donkeys were the parents of the all-white baby donkey, and he had acquired the Ws mutation from both parents, giving him two copies of the Ws gene. 
 The researchers were surprised the all-white, blue-eyed donkey survived past the embryonic stage, said Bellone. 
 A previous study on American and Australian white-spotted donkeys revealed they were all heterozygous for Ws, meaning they only had one copy of the mutation. 
 The fact that those researchers didn’t find any homozygous donkeys led them to believe if both parents passed on a copy of the mutation, the embryo wouldn’t survive long enough to develop into a foal. 
 The Ws/Ws donkey in their study might have lived long enough to be born because his body produced “just enough normal protein” to survive the embryonic stage but not enough mast cells and interstitial cells of Cajal to sustain life outside the womb, she added. 
 But breeding two white-spotted donkeys could lead to embryonic loss, fetal abortion, or the death of a young foal. 
Smart Breeding of White-Spotted Donkeys and Mules
 Thus far, scientists have found white spotting arising from the Ws variant in 52 donkeys from a variety of donkey breeds and the W variant in a single donkey of unknown breed, Bellone said. 
 They’ve never found a donkey with two copies of W, nor one with one W and one Ws, so scientists suspect such combinations probably lead to embryonic loss. 
 To avoid embryonic loss, abortion, and newborn deaths, breeders should avoid putting two white-spotted donkeys together, said Bellone. 
 Instead, if they want a healthy white-spotted baby, they should breed a white-spotted (W or Ws heterozygote) donkey with a solid-colored donkey (genotype N/N). 
 And considering that horses have 30 “W” variants of KIT genes that lead to white spotting, it might be advisable to avoid breeding white-spotted horses with white-spotted donkeys to create a white-spotted mule, she added. 
— Jazmyne Fertig is a 10-year-old soon-to-be fifth grader with an unusual best friend: a donkey — named Donkey.
Donkey wandered into her family’s pasture a few months ago.
 But after several more escapes to Jazmyne’s house, her neighbor gave Donkey to the 10-year-old. 
Donkey’s presence has been therapeutic for Jazmyne.
 It came to their attention that the reason Donkey kept escaping to Jazmyne’s yard was that he had lost a friend — the neighbor’s Clydesdale, who passed away recently. 
Jazmyne wanted to give Donkey a new four-hooved companion.
She told her JFCS caseworker her dilemma and asked if he could get her a donkey.
 They got to work, and it wasn’t long before Jazmyne and Donkey gained a third best friend, Willie. 
   Although there was damage throughout the farm, thankfully all the donkeys and mules seem ok, some of them just a little confused,   a post on the rescue's Facebook page said.

Tattoo app Tattoodo today launched a platform that lets people book appointments for tattoos around the world.
 A Tattoodo pilot program had made booking appointments with a limited number of tattoo shops possible in the past, but today‘s launch means users can now make appointments with individual artists, a company spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. 
 More than 300,000 tattoo artists have profiles on Tattoodo, according to the company. 
 Tattoodo is based in Copenhagen and was founded in 2013 by a group of founders that include Ami James, formerly of the reality shows Miami Ink and NY Ink. 
Tattoodo has until now focused on creating content about artists and the wider culture and growing its directory.
 Initial growth of the Tattoodo artist and studio directory came through outreach to popular artists, attending conventions, spreading content online, and reaching out to James‘ network. 
 The Tattoodo app for iOS and Android has been downloaded more than 4 million times, according to a statement provided to VentureBeat. 
 Copenhagen-based Tattoodo is the world’s largest tattoo community, with 30 million social followers and more than 500k registered tattoo artists. 
 Since it was founded in 2013, Tattoodo has focused on educating and entertaining its global audience with high-quality tattoo content. 
 Now, Tattoodo uses its position as the largest tattoo community in the world to offer its users the opportunity to book appointments directly through the Tattoodo app. 
 “Our user growth was extraordinary in 2018, and on most parameters, we’re doing better than ever,” said Caspar Høgh, Chief Operating Officer at Tattoodo. 
 Our booking feature gives users the means to access the best studios and artists in a convenient way and finally, tattooers will have the same benefits that other SMEs have had for the past ten years – receiving bookings with a click of a button,” said Johan Plenge, co-founder and CEO at Tattoodo. 
 “But Tattoodo, with its vast user base, has succeeded in doing just that. 
 Thus, Tattoodo has styled itself as a “digital lifestyle hub for all things tattoo-related.” 
Tattoodo is an online lifestyle outlet and marketplace that wants to be a one stop shop for the tattoo industry.
 Mik Thobo-Carlsen, executive chairman and co-founder of Tattoodo says the site is aiming to be a “home for not just tattoo-centric people, but those who have never even thought about entering into this permanent commitment as well” and he says the new investors have the media backgrounds to help the startup.

 Stencil ink is   created to look more like a tattoo stencil than an actual tattoo itself,   wrote Justine Morrow, the editorial manager for Tattoodo.com, a platform created to connect the tattoo community. 
 It was from that platform that James said, alongside the greater adoption of social media where everyone could find and follow their own favourite artists, that he got inspired for another business venture—Tattoodo, an app that provides an artist and studio directory where users can book tattoo artists worldwide. 
 Agger was well known for his ink when he was a Liverpool player and has become part of tattoo artist community Tattoodo, a company he's also invested in, since hanging up his boots. 
He owns one of the biggest outfits in the world named Tattoodo.
Agger said in an interview on Tattoodo's website:
 However, a new online booking platform, Tattoodo, is hoping to make it easier by connecting people around the world with tattoo shops. 
 Just as travellers use websites to book accommodation or tours, Tattoodo is a directory of artists and studios where users can book an appointment online, and search artists based on geography, style or trends. 
 Famous tattoo artists like Miami-Ink star Ami James, who is a co-founder of Tattoodo, and Megan Massacre are available to book through the platform. 
 And just like they can go to Lonely Planet to get recommendations on where to stay and what to eat, they can go to Tattoodo to get guidance on making sure they're getting their dream tattoo.” 
 According to Tattoodo, minimalist, geometric, and floral tattoos are among the most popular body art trends for 2019. 
Tattoodo says there’s a trend for geometric designs paired with more natural influences – say an angular shape layered over a flower’s petals.
 Ami James, co-founder of Tattoodo and Miami-ink star, says: ‘The main styles – American traditional, Japanese style, black & grey, Polynesian style, and so on – those are timeless. 
 According to tattoo community Tattoodo, the movement is a modern version of the   ironic   design, which was pioneered by French graffiti artist Fuzi Uvtpk in the '90s when he started to stray from conventional tattooing by using his street art on skin. 
 Johan Plenge, cofounder and CEO at Tattoodo, told POPSUGAR that the style is massively popular right now, making it easy to find a reputable tattoo artist to create one for you.
