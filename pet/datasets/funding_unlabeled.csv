,× Expand Photo by Caitlin Abrams picnic essentials Gear Up: The best picnic is a spontaneous picnic  so keep essentials at the ready in the back of your rig.
,We paired our large tote with the perfect picnic blanket  which has just the right amount of thickness  a smooth surface (won’t attract grass and twigs)  and fabric that won’t easily snag.
,Banh mi sandwiches are one of life’s picnic triumphs: French-Vietnamese hybrids in which an airy baguette is stuffed with aioli and a harmony of herbs  quick-pickled vegetables  and fillings such as tofu or grilled chicken.
,Tell the kids you’re going to have a fancy picnic like ones you see in magazines.
,When you pull up in front of Yum!  pop your trunk and a nice person will put your picnic in your car.
,Choose a picnic site with a grill  light a match—yep  you’re officially a picnic rock star.
,Picnic is the first full-length collaboration between Kansas City’s Ryan Loecker (aka mdo  co-founder of the C Minus label) and Melbourne  Australia’s Justin Cantrell (aka ju ca  founder of the Daisart label).
,But the communal spirit of Secret Musik lives on in Picnic  which doubles as an international ambient summit welcoming Australia’s Daisart into the fold.
,Heavy on guest features and bundled with more than 80 minutes of remixes  both on the digital album and the limited-edition Bonus CD  Picnic is a celebration of ambient music as a social phenomenon.
,The vinyl version of Picnic runs eight tracks and 41 minutes  including a remix of C Minus co-founder Pil’s “Plush Hooves.”
,But Picnic delights in the way these materials interact.
,There’s an appealing sense of grit throughout Picnic  suggesting sediment flowing downstream or embers leaping from a bonfire.
,Picnic offers few moments of uninterrupted ambient pleasure.
,The bulk of Picnic’s real estate is taken up by percussion  which means both actual percussion instruments and the digital clicks and cuts that saturate nearly every inch of the record.
,Picnic deserves credit for managing such a rough and organic sound without being too hard on the ears  but it’s tough to just sink back into this stuff and relax  and ambient fans who like their music a little more amniotic might find the terrain too rugged for their liking.

,A fast charging station of Dutch charging company Fastned is pictured during its opening in Limburg  Germany  June 22  2018.
,Dutch charging infrastructure company Fastned (FASTN.AS) has teamed up with Tesla (TSLA.O) to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Oxford  England  it said on Friday  sending its shares higher.
,The hub of 38 charging stations  will include 26 ultra-rapid chargers from Fastned and Tesla  with additional AC chargers from Spain's Wenea  and is scheduled to open at the end of 2021.
,The intial 10 Fastned charging stations will be able to charge EVs simultaneously at rates allowing drivers to add up to 300 miles (482.8 km) of range in 20 minutes  the company said.
,Fastned shares rose almost 8% to 55.6 euros at 0837 GMT.
,"should indeed help (Fastned) further increase its public profile in the UK and may allow it to replicate the same development strategy in other municipalities across Europe "" Berenberg's research analyst Jan Richard said."
,The hub will be Europe's most powerful electric vehicle charging hub with up to 10 megawatts of power available for future expansion  Fastned said.
,Fastned  based in Amsterdam  has built 137 fast charging stations across the Belgium  Britain  Germany  Switzerland and the Netherlands and aims to expand into France.
,And this is exactly what Amsterdam-based Fastned provides – a fast-charging network for electric vehicles.
,In a recent development  Fastned announced that it has teamed up with Oxford City Council  Pivot Power  Tesla  and Wenea to build and operate one of its largest fast-charging stations at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford (ESO).
,A large  fast-charging station - with Fastned and Tesla chargers - will be built at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford on Oxford’s ring road in the UK  as the fruit of a partnership between Pivot Power  Oxford City Council & Wenea.
,up to 14 Fastned chargers (10 initially)  rated at up to 300 kW
,The site will get up to a 10 MW power supply from renewable sources (part of that will be Fastned's solar canopy) and an energy storage system.
,"""Fastned  the European fast charging company  teams up with Oxford City Council  Pivot Power and Wenea to build and operate one of it’s largest fast charging stations at the upcoming Energy Superhub Oxford."
,The Fastned station will have up to 14 fast chargers and there will be 12 Tesla Superchargers on site.
,It all started with Ola’s acquisition of the Amsterdam-based EV startup Etergo BV  which had to undergo a fire sale or face bankruptcy.
,Now the Indian unicorn plans to utilise Etergo’s App Scooter design and engineering capabilities to build a smart electric two-wheeler.
,Lauded as the ‘Tesla of e-scooters’ by the European and Dutch media  Etergo was a crowdfunded initiative that raised millions of euros in two crowdfunding rounds.
,But after raising around €21 Mn ($24.8 Mn) in equity financing from more than 6 000 individual investors (most of them were carried away by the e-scooter craze)  the company got sold to Ola Electric for €3.75 Mn ($4.44 Mn) valuation  according to internal emails and multiple Etergo investors who spoke to Inc42.
,More than 900 investors who put their money into Etergo through crowdfunding campaigns are now in the process of filing a lawsuit in a European court to recover their money from Etergo and its current owner Ola Electric.
,Many of them have held onto their shares since 2017  hoping to get their hands on the swanky App Scooters promised by Etergo.
,Founded in 2014 by Bart Jacobsz Rosier and Marijn Flipse  Etergo had conceptualised an all-electric state-of-the-art AppScooter that depends on battery-swapping for a quick recharge and an increased run time.
,But according to two investors aware of Etergo’s operations in the Netherlands  even after three years of research and development since 2015  not a single scooter was delivered to people who purchased actual shares in the company via a pseudo-public offering.
,Etergo BV diluted around 10% equity stake in September 2017 and set up a STAK with targeted funding of €1.5 Mn ($1.7Mn)  which was also its first publicly raised money.
,Etergo used Seedrs  a platform that allows European retail investors to buy shares in private companies.
,The Seedrs page for Etergo is still live and indicates that the scooter was supposed to go into production by Q2 2018.
,“Although the first public funding (crowdfunding) happened via Seedrs  the owners of the company later used their own website to gather and raise funds  as they started getting momentum for their brand… Everything was fine until late 2019  and I got some email from the (investor relations) team promising that the scooter would be delivered by March 2020  and then suddenly it was sold to an Indian company by May 2020  and none of us got any such heads  and I learnt from the news itself ” says an Amsterdam-based investor who picked up shares worth €5 000 in Etergo in 2017.
,A copy of the prospectus issued by the company and reviewed by Inc42 reveals that Etergo was valued at north of €65 Mn in March 2019.
,But after the buyout  the per-share price came down to €0.0179986  according to emails sent to Etergo investors in May 2020.
,The email also mentioned that they might redeem their shares at €0.0179986 per unit  which according to Inc42’s estimates  values Etergo at around €3.75 Mn after the Ola buyout.
,Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans  according to the most comprehensive study to date.

,The Dutch-French e-scooter company Dott may not be as ubiquitous as the likes of Bolt and TIER  both of whom have hit the 100-city mark  however it is expanding with deliberate care  with an eye on long-term investments in cities.
,"Maxim Romain  the co-founder and COO of Dott  spoke to Tech.eu’s Crossing Borders series about their international growth  why they prefer tenders  and opens up about their ""most costly"" business mistake."
,Having one of Dott’s two headquarters in Amsterdam “is not ideal” Romain says  as the company is not operating in the Dutch capital (their other HQ is in Paris).
,Dott  which has around 300 staff  has raised around €120 million  significantly less than competitors TIER and Voi  who have each pulled in around three times that.
,Dott co-founder and CEO Henri Moissinac said in an interview earlier this year that this “is not a game where you need to be everywhere.
,The only city they have exited so far is Munich  as consumer interest in scooters was not significant enough - not exclusively a Dott problem  Romain says competitors faced similar difficulties in the Bavarian capital.
,Dott keeps all their operations in-house  and doesn't use gig workers  for example  as juicers  which Romain says gives them an advantage with city authorities.
,The competitive landscape is a key consideration when identifying new cities to launch in for Dott — they are not in Berlin for example  as they consider it to be quite a saturated market.
,Dott prefers cities that organise tenders  as winning one helps ensure that their investment will be a long-term one.
,"As for the sustainability aspect  he says that they have done a lot of studies and found ""to our disappointment"" that users are not as focused on sustainability as Dott had hoped or expected  although the younger generation is progressively paying more attention to it."
,"Romain says Dott's ""most costly mistake"" was with an early fleet of scooters."
,The Dott co-founder has a pre-expansion tip for new startup founders: define your company culture from the very start.
,to discuss values and culture on day one at the company but that’s what we did at Dott  our first brainstorm was about this  and there's nothing I'm more proud of in relation to Dott than the quality of the culture and the team.”
,In fact  the research  commissioned by micro-mobility company Dott  found that we’re so bad at local discovery that almost half (45%) of Brits surveyed don’t know the names of streets near their home and a quarter admitted to not being able to direct a stranger to a destination in the town where they live.
,Duncan Robertson  Dott UK General Manager  said: “We’re excited to be launching our e-scooter hire service in the UK  and to be trialling this in London  to allow people to explore the city in a fun  economical  sustainable but - most importantly - safe new way.

,Bidroom is a travel booking platform aimed at bringing fairness back to the booking industry by providing low-priced hotel rooms to travelers and helping hotels save money in commission fees.
,Travelers can try Bidroom for free to see the value of its innovative platform.
,Thanks to Bidroom  travelers who are scouring the web for places to stay — and  hopefully cashing in some credit card rewards to boot — can access some of the lowest prices available for hotel rooms around the world.
,Bidroom was founded in 2016 by CEO Michael Ros.
,The basic premise is that travelers can become a member of Bidroom and gain access to great deals on hotel rooms.
,That means that  when travelers pay to become a Bidroom member — which is only $29 per year — they ultimately save a lot of money by taking advantage of the discounted rates accessible only through the innovative platform.
,The overarching idea behind the Bidroom model is to bring fairness to the travel industry.
,“We are a bridge connecting the hotels to their guests directly  giving control back to the hotels and the best prices possible to our members ” according to the Bidroom website.
,Hotel bookings are the main focus for Bidroom but members also gain access to a bevy of what Ros calls travel extras  made possible through partnerships with various companies in the travel industry.
,These are all included as part of a Bidroom annual membership.
,“We don’t earn anything on this  like for example with Avis  people get a 15% discount just by having a Bidroom membership ” Ros said.
,These travel extras also include hotel perks such as late checkout  early check-in  wifi upgrades  and other benefits  according to the Bidroom website.
,Bidroom announced in 2019 that its members can now use Apple Pay for added convenience and security.
,Travelers who have booked through another service (for rooms without cancellation penalties) can send Bidroom their booking confirmation.
,Bidroom will then prepare an offer at a lower rate for the same room.

,Amsterdam  May 10th  2021 - Online manufacturing platform 3D Hubs today announced it has rebranded to Hubs.
,Hubs  formerly 3D Hubs  is an online manufacturing platform that provides engineers with on-demand access to a global network of manufacturing partners.

,VanMoof first came on my radar when Apple announced the first few products that were compatible with the Find My network.
,The VanMoof S3 and X3 joined the likes of Belkin’s SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot item finder as the first third-party with built-in Find My integration.
,And while I was initially most excited to learn how Find My would work with a bike  the VanMoof S3  with its sleek black exterior  simple lines  and uber-clean weld seams  had me wanting one to call my own.
,Watch my hands-on video as I take the VanMoof S3 for a ride around the block  and be sure to subscribe to 9to5mac on YouTube for more.
,Video: VanMoof S3 – it’s like if Apple made an e-bike
,The first thing that stood out to me upon receipt of the VanMoof S3 is how the bike is packaged.
,Simply put  the design of the VanMoof S3 is the best that I’ve ever seen in a bike  electric or otherwise.
,The VanMoof S3  on the other hand  takes the exact opposite approach.
,After setting up the bike  you’ll need to download the VanMoof app from the App Store and set up your account.
,Settings is where I found myself most of the time while using the VanMoof app.
,Being one of only three third-party products initially compatible with Apple’s Find My network  this was the feature that initially put the VanMoof S3 on my radar.
,Locking the VanMoof S3 literally takes just a few seconds  thanks to the built-in kick lock on the rear wheel.
,But in Apple-like fashion  I found the VanMoof S3 easy to learn.
,The VanMoof S3 does this in a very natural way  with the front-mounted hub motor assisting with just a faint whirring sound.
,As you pedal  the VanMoof S3’s motor provides assistance  which can help you to easily power up a steep hill or quickly speed off on a straightaway.

,At the same time  co-founder of Hiber Laurens Groenendijk is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives ” the company said in a statement.
,Coen Janssen  chief strategy officer and co-founder of Hiber  commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector.

,Google is far from the first to do this  as apps like Aysa  Miiskin and SkinVision have been around for a few years.
,They are also invited to use the SkinVision app  which helps to identify common types of skin cancer by assessing skin spots and moles.
,Examples include Miiskin  SkinVision  and MoleScope  which has a skin-magnifying attachment for your phone.
,"Amsterdam-based skin cancer screening app SkinVision has raised $7.6 million in new funding from existing investors Leo Pharma and PHS Fund  with additional contributions from undisclosed new backers described by the company as ""high net worth impact investors."""
,SkinVision's app is currently available in the UK  Australia  New Zealand  and much of Europe.
,While SkinVision is working towards primarily offering the service via insurance providers  they also offer a direct-to-consumer option that has helped them to train their algorithms.
,de Heus is confident that the company's algorithm is reliable  although like most companies in the space SkinVision is careful to market itself as a non-diagnostic offering that complements a dermatologist.
,SkinVision will also use the funding to move toward an FDA submission in preparation for a US launch.
,The study focused on nine studies of different downloadable algorithm-based smartphone apps  including the widely available SkinVision.
,The authors highlight the “concern (...) about the impact of false reassurances” as the apps themselves market this trust  with SkinVision claiming to offer “a complete skin cancer detection service (...) to make sure you stay safe”  whilst lacking the adequate performance to back it up.
,However  in the study  they mistakenly refer to an app called skinScan from TeleSkin  based on a study from 2014  which they now understand was in fact looking at an earlier version of SkinVision.
,For instance  in 2019  SkinVision was integrated into the NHS.
,In a statement  SkinVision said: “We believe that for the benefit of public health  all algorithm-based smartphone apps should be researched and would like to continue leading by example  as we continue supporting clinical research of our algorithm.
,Digital health startup SkinVision is using smartphone tech and vision algorithms to allow consumers to track changes to their moles.

,Add photos  text  and points of interest and Polarsteps will do the rest.
,This is exactly what Polarsteps makes possible.
,If you are starting with Polarsteps  please add your Polarsteps trip before starting your trip via the Travel tab.
,Once you hit the road  Polarsteps will start tracking your ride.
,Polarsteps then asks you to fill in a so-called “step” every time you open the app.
,If you travel regularly and use Polarsteps  you can see exactly which routes you’ve traveled and where you come from most often.
,You can do this by viewing all the steps of your journey  but you can also create a picture book from Polarsteps.
,Polarsteps picture book is the only revenue model for the app developed in the Netherlands – the app is free and the developers do not intend to fill the app with ads.
,Polarsteps can be downloaded for free from the file Google Play Store On Apple App Store.
,What do you think of the concept of Polarsteps?
,Polarsteps just raised a seed round to continue developing its automated travel blogging app  to make the jealousy-machine run just that tiny bit smoother.
,Polarsteps is optimized for travel  which means that you don’t need data roaming or cell coverage to let the app do its thing: GPS works independently of mobile reception and the app synchronizes its data whenever you hit a pocket of cell reception — or when you log in to the Wi-Fi at the hotel at the end of a long  dusty day of travel.
,He clarifies that the Beta label reflects that the app currently has a limited feature-set and that it signals that Polarsteps is under active development.
,The implementation of Polarsteps is very well done  but the idea itself is not particularly original: there have been a slew of companies and solutions in this space over the years.
,Zivver  an Amsterdam-based challenger business in secure communications  has raised $17 million in new funding  bringing its total funding to date to over $30 million.
,Thanks to the new funding  Zivver plans to add in other features like digital signatures  secure forms and secure video.
,“With 40 percent of Dutch hospitals and local government and the entire Dutch Judicial System as customers  Zivver’s technology is proven to safeguard people’s personal data  which is essential as data protection regulations continue to evolve ” says Rick Goud  the startup’s CIO and co-founder.
,Zivver was named in Gartner’s 2020 Market Guide for Email Security as a Representative Vendor for Email Data Protection Specialists; awarded a place on the UK government’s G-Cloud 12 Framework for its cloud software services; and won a contract withinn the NHSX Clinical Communication Tools Procurement Framework  in partnership with Barrier Networks.
,Rick Goud is the CIO of secure digital communication enabler  Zivver.
,Before co-founding Zivver  Rick spent six years as a healthcare consultant for Gupta Strategists.
,He realised there was a strong need for a secure communication solution to safeguard and manage such data (including for DPA and GDPR compliance) – and shortly afterwards  Zivver was born.
,LONDON and AMSTERDAM – 12 November 2020 – Zivver  a challenger business in secure communications  today announced the availability of Zivver for Gmail  bringing the potential of enhanced email security and user experience to the millions of organisations worldwide using Google Workspace (formerly G Suite).
,The Zivver for Gmail extension gives organisations an effective way to prevent data leaks while not having to change their way of working.
,With Zivver for Gmail  organisations can share sensitive information via email with complete peace of mind.
,"This applies to both the information in the email and files in the attachments "" said Rick Goud  CIO & co-founder of Zivver."
,Zivver  identified as one of the five representative vendors in the 'Email Data Protection Specialists' category in Gartner's '2020 Market Guide for Email Security'  has always integrated seamlessly with the world’s most popular work email client  Microsoft Outlook (Desktop and Microsoft 365).
,Zivver comfortably fits in with existing ways of working.
,Users can easily add Zivver to their Gmail workflow and send communications as they normally would.
,Pioneering healthcare organisation Buurtzorg  active in 25 countries  participated in Zivver’s Gmail beta testing.

,Below we look at the patent filing strategy used by one of the winning companies awarded funding by NHSX  Aidence  based in the Netherlands.
,Aidence  who have developed AI-driven solutions for the oncology pathway  particularly for lung cancer screening  filed a patent application initially in the Netherlands in 2017  for a method which they have developed using a deep neural network to process 3D image data.
,Based on the initial local application  Aidence used the priority system to file an International (PCT) application  and extend their pending patent protection to Europe  Canada  China  Japan  and the USA.
,This strategy also has the advantage that the initial application provides an early indication on patentability from the national office at which the application is filed – in the case of Aidence's application  the Netherlands Patent Office.
,Here Aidence benefitted from a very positive initial search report from the Netherlands patent office  which can be of real value to early-stage companies seeking investment to demonstrate to investors that the company is likely to secure protection for their technology.
,"Once the PCT application is converted into the ""national phase"" applications in the countries of interest (in Aidence's case  Europe  Canada  China  Japan  and the USA) the applications may proceed at different rates and not all patent offices will take the same view of the application."
,Aidence's application is still currently pending at the European Patent Office (EPO).
,This strategy places Aidence in a strong position to secure valuable protection for its technology  but this is just one example of a possible patent filing strategy to support the successful scaling and commercialisation of a new AI-driven HealthTech technology.
,Some of the prominent players operating in the AI in medical diagnostics market are Microsoft Corporation (US)  NVIDIA (US)  IBM (US)  Intel (US)  Siemens Healthineers (Germany)  GE Healthcare (US)  Digital Diagnostics (US)  Xilinx (US)  InformAI (US)  Enlitic (US)  Day Zero Diagnostics (US)  Aidence (Netherlands)  Butterfly Network  Inc.
,Dutch-based medical AI company Aidence has won an AI in Health and Care Award to support the NHS plans to reduce lung cancer mortality.
,Aidence merited the award by showing that their AI-enabled image analysis application  Veye  can improve early lung cancer detection  and validate and accelerate the use of AI in healthcare.
,Aidence’s submission proved that its AI solutions can increase the speed and accuracy of early lung cancer detection.
,Aidence’s first application  Veye Chest  is analyses chest CT scans and is integrated into several NHS hospitals to detect  classify  and track the growth of potential lung cancers.
,At Aidence  we know AI has tremendous value in clinical practice  and we believe AI-enabled oncology pathways can transform cancer care.”

,Otrium has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its $26 million Series B round.
,The concept behind Otrium is quite simple.
,When items reach the end-of-season status  brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them.
,Otrium is currently available in Europe.
,With Otrium  brands can add another sales channel for those specific items.
,And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items  Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies.
,The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.
,Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time.
,With today’s funding round  Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses  such as Karl Lagerfeld  Joseph  Anine Bing  Belstaff  Reiss and ASICS.
,Dutch end-of-season fashion online marketplace Otrium has bagged US$120 million in its Series C financing round  which will go towards its upcoming U.S. launch and improving its technology platform.
,Otrium  the Amsterdam-headquartered online fashion “outlet” selling unsold end-of-season items  has raised US$120 million in a Series C round co-led by tech venture capital BOND and London-San Francisco investment firm Index Ventures.
,Otrium added that the Series C funds will support hiring and the growth of its team.
,Founded by Milan Daniels and Max Klijnstra in 2015  Otrium  which currently operates in Europe  enables clothing brand partners to sell their off-season inventory in order to avoid unsold fashion items from ending up in the landfills – or in many cases  especially for luxury labels  destroyed or burned in the name of brand exclusivity.
,Milan Daniels  Co-Founder & CEO  Otrium
,Particularly amid the pandemic  Otrium says that its digital business model  which embeds both convenience and sustainability  has flourished  with its revenues having tripled over 2020 despite the broader economic downturn for high street and brick-and-mortar players.

,By issuing guidelines calling for European regulators not to ban companies in the sharing space  startups like Peerby (a Dutch peer-to-peer lending platform for household goods) can count on fewer roadblocks as they forecast future growth.
,“In the end  the sharing economy will bring more benefits to [everyone] ” says Peerby founder Daan Weddepohl  who is scheduled to speak at this week’s Wharton Global Forum in Amsterdam.
,Peerby  the Dutch startup that allows people to search for things they need  like a hedge trimmer or a disco ball  has 250 000 users within communities in the Netherlands  major European cities and in the U.S.  Weddepohl says  adding that there is close to $1 billion worth of products available on the platform.
,Peerby is a “business model that takes underutilized assets and puts them to use ” Weddepohl says.
,He got the idea for Peerby when a fire in his apartment destroyed all his belongings and home in 2009.
,He turned the idea into the sharing service Peerby  which just won Weddepohl that oversized cheque at the AppMyCity competiton for best urban app  held as part of the New Cities Summit in Dallas  Texas.
,The app is simple: Peerby users can send out a request for an item they want to borrow.
,He opens Peerby on his iPhone to show me a map of his neighbourhood in Amsterdam: a sea of Peerby logos  with dozens of users on every street.
,One of the runners up to Peerby was Djump  a “social ridesharing” service that acts something like a hitch-hiking app.
,But unlike Airbnb or Uber  which take explicit aim at breaking into specific industries  Djump and Peerby are non-monetised apps that simply make it easier for city people to do what small-town folk have always done: hitch a ride  borrow some sugar.
,Dutch startup and TechStars London first cohort member Peerby is hoping to unlock the use value of that stuff with a collaborative consumption model that features some crucial differences when compared to others who’ve tried to turn caring into sharing for neighbourhoods.
,On Peerby  which has already launched successfully and grown at a fairly rapid clip at home in the Netherlands  users post requests for items that they need from their surrounding community  rather than just offering up a list of available “inventory” based on what they owned and are willing to share  the way it works on other networks that have attempted similar things in the past like Neighborgoods and StreetLend.
,“We’re launched basically in the whole of Holland ” Peerby co-founder and CTO Eelke Boezeman told me in an interview.
,Peerby’s request-based system for local borrowing and lending has earned it fairly high success and engagement rates – the startup claims that over 80 percent of its requests are fulfilled by Peerby members within 30 minutes of their posting.
,They maintain that this is because on Peerby  you aren’t dependent on having to find what you’re looking for before you request it.

,Both ChargePoint and EVBox have more established and diversified networks.
,EVBox has sold more than 235 000 charge ports  the most of any company.
,The business combination bringing EVBox public is expected to close in June 2021.
,Based on the valuation initially presented when the merger was announced  EVBox would have a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion at the current share price.
,That makes EVBox clearly cheaper on a price-to-sales basis  as ChargePoint's market cap is approximately $6.5 billion.
,The most concerning news is that the TPGY/EVBox SPAC deal may fall apart.
,Potentially the biggest SPAC news today is that the TPG Pace Beneficial (TPGY) / EVBox merger may be falling apart.
,It plunged -12.5% following an 8-K that called doubt as to whether their deal with EVBox will ultimately be completed.
,Adding more fast charging stations on the nation’s roads would bring down these barriers and accelerate EV adoption in the United States  according to a report from market research firm Ipsos and EVBox Group  a global provider of EV charging stations.
